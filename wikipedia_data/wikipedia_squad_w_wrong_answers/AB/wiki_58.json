For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution. Although Dawkins invented the term 'meme' and developed meme theory, the possibility that ideas were subject to the same pressures of evolution as were biological attributes was discussed in Darwin's time. T. H. Huxley claimed that 'The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.'\nDawkins used the term to refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator. He hypothesized that one could view many cultural entities as replicators, and pointed to melodies, fashions and learned skills as examples. Memes generally replicate through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient copiers of information and behavior. Because humans do not always copy memes perfectly, and because they may refine, combine or otherwise modify them with other memes to create new memes, they can change over time.

To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956.

She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.\nMonroe returned to the public eye in the spring of 1962; she received a \"World Film Favorite\" Golden Globe Award and began to shoot a new film for 20th Century Fox, \"Something's Got to Give\", a re-make of \"My Favorite Wife\" (1940). It was to be co-produced by MMP, directed by George Cukor and to co-star Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse. Days before filming began, Monroe caught sinusitis; despite medical advice to postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April. Monroe was too ill to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to put pressure on her by alleging publicly that she was faking it. On May 19, she took a break to sing \"Happy Birthday\" on stage at President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in New York.

When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of \"Cleopatra\" (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production.

To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for \"Life\" and \"Cosmopolitan\" and her first photo shoot for \"Vogue\".

The 1940s had been the heyday of actresses who were perceived as tough and smart, such as Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, film stars who had appealed to women-dominated audiences. The studio wanted Monroe to be a star of the new decade who would draw men to movie theaters. From the beginning, she played a significant part in the creation of her public image, and towards the end of her career Monroe exerted almost full control over it. Monroe devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as Sidney Skolsky and Louella Parsons, and controlled the use of her images. In addition to Grable, she was often compared to another iconic blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow. The comparison was prompted partly by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair.\nMonroe's screen persona centered on her blonde hair and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, na\u00efvet\u00e9, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was \"utterly innocent and uncalculated\", parodying herself with double entendres that came to be known as \"Monroeisms\". For example, when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, \"I had the radio on\". Monroe began her career as a pin-up model, and her hourglass figure was often one of her most noted features. Film scholar Richard Dyer wrote that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and that she often posed like a pin-up in her publicity photos. Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body and earned her the nickname \"the girl with the horizontal walk\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Clothing played an important factor in Monroe's star image.

In the 1950s, she also studied comedy in classes given by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performances, and had her accompany her on film sets to instruct her. In \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", one of the films in which she played an archetypal dumb blonde, Monroe had the sentence \"I can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it\" added to her character's lines in the script.\nDyer has stated that Monroe's star image was created mainly for the male gaze and that she usually played \"the girl\", who is defined solely by her gender, in her films. Her roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations where \"the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men.\" Film scholar Thomas Harris, who analyzed Monroe's public image in 1957, wrote that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available, \"the ideal playmate\", in contrast to her contemporary, Grace Kelly, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background came to be seen as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to Dyer, Monroe became \"virtually a household name for sex\" in the 1950s and \"her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the fifties in America\", such as Freudian ideas about sex, the Kinsey report (1953), and Betty Friedan's \"The Feminine Mystique\" (1963). By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal, Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s \"femme fatales\". Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of \"the postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful of men, na\u00efve, offering sex without demands\", which is echoed in Molly Haskell's statement that \"she was the fifties fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs.\" Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that \"Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her\", while Groucho Marx characterized her as \"Mae West, Theda Bara, and Bo Peep all rolled into one\".

According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in \"Look\" in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with African-American singing coach Phil Moore.\nMonroe was perceived as a specifically American star, \"a national institution as well known as hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball\" according to \"Photoplay\". Banner calls her the symbol of populuxe, a star whose joyful and glamorous public image \"helped the nation cope with its paranoia in the 1950s about the Cold War, the atom bomb, and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union\".

Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.\nDue to the contrast between her stardom and troubled private life, Monroe is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media, fame, and consumer culture. According to academic Susanne Hamscha, Monroe has continued relevance to ongoing discussions about modern society, and she is \"never completely situated in one time or place\" but has become \"a surface on which narratives of American culture can be (re-)constructed\", and \"functions as a cultural type that can be reproduced, transformed, translated into new contexts, and enacted by other people\".

The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles. This makes possible both total (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and annular (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses. In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye. Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time, the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing. Also, as it evolves toward becoming a red giant, the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing. The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible.

However, in the , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance.

Kublai received the brothers with hospitality and asked them many questions regarding the European legal and political system. He also inquired about the Pope and Church in Rome.

The Italian scholar Luigi Foscolo Benedetto had previously demonstrated that the book was written in the same \"leisurely, conversational style\" that characterised Rustichello's other works, and that some passages in the book were taken verbatim or with minimal modifications from other writings by Rustichello. For example, the opening introduction in \"The Book of Marvels\" to \"emperors and kings, dukes and marquises\" was lifted straight out of an Arthurian romance Rustichello had written several years earlier, and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter's court is almost the same as that of the arrival of Tristan at the court of King Arthur at Camelot in that same book.

Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, and in particular the difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority, however, have since been identified).

In many cases where present (mostly given in the first part before he reached China, such as mentions of Christian miracles), he made a clear distinction that they are what he had heard rather than what he had seen.

His accounts are therefore unlikely to have been obtained second hand. Other accounts have also been verified; for example, when visiting Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, China, Marco Polo noted that a large number of Christian churches had been built there. His claim is confirmed by a Chinese text of the 14th century explaining how a Sogdian named Mar-Sargis from Samarkand founded six Nestorian Christian churches there in addition to one in Hangzhou during the second half of the 13th century.

His failure to note the presence of the Great Wall of China was first raised in the middle of seventeenth century, and in the middle of eighteenth century, it was suggested that he might have never reached China. Later scholars such as John W. Haeger argued the Marco Polo might not have visited Southern China due to the lack of details in his description of southern Chinese cities compared to northern ones, while Herbert Franke also raised the possibility that Marco Polo might not have been to China at all, and wondered if he might have based his accounts on Persian sources due to his use of Persian expressions. This is taken further by Dr. Frances Wood who claimed in her 1995 book \"Did Marco Polo Go to China?\" that at best Polo never went farther east than Persia (modern Iran), and that there is nothing in \"The Book of Marvels\" about China that could not be obtained via reading Persian books.

They note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both north and south of today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan dynasty, could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Haw also argued that footbinding was not common even among Chinese during Polo's time and almost unknown among the Mongols.

Marco Polo himself noted (in the Toledo manuscript) the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very short steps. It has also been noted by other scholars that many of the things not mentioned by Marco Polo such as tea and chopsticks were not mentioned by other travelers as well. Haw also pointed out that despite the few omissions, Marco Polo's account is more extensive, more accurate and more detailed than those of other foreign travelers to China in this period. Marco Polo even observed Chinese nautical inventions such as the watertight compartments of bulkhead partitions in Chinese ships, knowledge of which he was keen to share with his fellow Venetians.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Many scholars believe that Marco Polo exaggerated his importance in China.

Herbert Franke noted that all occurrences of Po-lo or Bolod (an Altaic word meaning \"steel\") in Yuan texts were names of people of Mongol or Turkic extraction. The sinologist Paul Pelliot thought that Polo might have served as an officer of the government salt monopoly in Yangzhou, which was a position of some significance that could explain the exaggeration. Polo also claimed to have provided the Mongols with technical advice on building mangonels during the Siege of Xiangyang, a claim that cannot possibly be true as the siege was over before Polo had arrived in China.

Haw sees this as a reasonable claim if Marco was a \"keshig\", who numbered some fourteen thousand at the time. Haw explains how the earliest manuscripts of Polo's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou, with some stating he was just a simple resident, others stating he was a governor, and Ramusio's manuscript claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else, yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan.

However neither of these accounts mentions Polo or indeed any European as part of the bridal party, and Wood used the lack of mention of Polo in these works as an example of Polo's \"retelling of a well-known tale\". Morgan, in Polo's defence, noted that even the princess herself was not mentioned in the Chinese source, and that it would have been surprising if Polo had been mentioned by Rashid-al-Din. Historian Igor de Rachewiltz argued that Marco Polo's account in fact allows the Persian and Chinese sources to be reconciled \u2013 by relaying the information that two of the three envoys sent (mentioned in the Chinese source and whose names accord with those given by Polo) had died during the voyage, it explains why only the third who survived, Coja/Khoja, was mentioned by Rash\u00ecd al-D\u00ecn.

Vogel noted that no other Western, Arab, or Persian sources have given such accurate and unique details about the currencies of China, for example, the shape and size of the paper, the use of seals, the various denominations of paper money as well as variations in currency usage in different regions of China, such as the use of cowry shells in Yunnan, details supported by archaeological evidence and Chinese sources compiled long after Polo's had left China. His accounts of salt production and revenues from the salt monopoly are also accurate, and accord with Chinese documents of the Yuan era. Economic historian Mark Elvin, in his preface to Vogel's 2013 monograph, concludes that Vogel \"demonstrates by specific example after specific example the ultimately overwhelming probability of the broad authenticity\" of Polo's account. Many problems were caused by the oral transmission of the original text and the proliferation of significantly different hand-copied manuscripts. For instance, did Polo exert \"political authority\" (\"seignora\") in Yangzhou or merely \"sojourn\" (\"sejourna\") there. Elvin concludes that \"those who doubted, although mistaken, were not always being casual or foolish\", but \"the case as a whole had now been closed\": the book is, \"in essence, authentic, and, when used with care, in broad terms to be trusted as a serious though obviously not always final, witness.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Other lesser-known European explorers had already travelled to China, such as Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, but Polo's book meant that his journey was the first to be widely known.
