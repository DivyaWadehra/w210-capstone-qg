It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminated blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Damascus steel is a form of pattern welding with similarities to laminate construction.

Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy allow them to be heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.\nSteel blades are commonly shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades are made by heating a single piece of steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Knives are sharpened in various ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge in a straight or convex line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend to the back of the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have concave, beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts. Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade.

In \"The Anti-Death League\", \"The Green Man\", \"The Alteration\" and elsewhere, including poems such as \"The Huge Artifice: an interim assessment\" and \"New Approach Needed\", Amis showed frustration with a God who could lace the world with cruelty and injustice, and championed the preservation of ordinary human happiness \u2013 in family, in friendships, in physical pleasure \u2013 against the demands of any cosmological scheme.

That same year, he wrote \"The Book of Bond, or, Every Man His Own 007\", a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual about being a sophisticated spy, under the pseudonym \"Lt Col.

Amis took the anthology in a markedly new direction: Auden had interpreted light verse to include \"low\" verse of working-class or lower-class origin, regardless of subject matter, while Amis defined light verse as essentially light in tone, though not necessarily simple in composition. \"The Amis Anthology\" (1988), a personal selection of his favourite poems, grew out of his work for a London newspaper, in which he selected a poem daily and presented it with a brief introduction.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Amis was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times \u2013 for \"Ending Up\" (1974) and \"Jake's Thing\" (1978), and finally, winning the prize, for \"The Old Devils\" in 1986.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked Kingsley Amis 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.", "qas": []}, {"context": "As a young man at Oxford, Amis joined the Communist Party.

For 'many years', Amis imposed a rigorous daily schedule upon himself in which writing and drinking were strictly segregated. Mornings were devoted to writing with a minimum daily output of 500 words. The drinking would only begin around lunchtime when this output had been achieved.

Double-width fabric is woven so that the pattern exactly matches on the selvage. Kilts are usually made without a hem because a hem would make the garment too bulky and cause it to hang incorrectly. The exact amount of fabric needed depends upon several factors including the size of the sett, the number of pleats put into the garment, and the size of the person. For a full kilt, 8 yards of fabric would be used regardless of size and the number of pleats and depth of pleat would be adjusted according to their size.

The association of particular patterns with individual clans and families can be traced back perhaps one or two centuries.

Up until this point, Highland tartans held regional associations rather than being identified with any particular clan.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Today there are also tartans for districts, counties, societies and corporations.

They are specified by their thread counts, the sequence of colours and their units of width. As an example, the Wallace tartan has a thread count given as \"K/4 R32 K32 Y/4\" (K is black, R is red, and Y is yellow). This means that 4 units of black thread will be succeeded by 32 units of red, etc., in both the warp and the weft. Typically, the units are the actual number of threads, but as long as the proportions are maintained, the resulting pattern will be the same. This thread count also includes a pivot point indicated by the slash between the colour and thread number. The weaver is supposed to reverse the weaving sequence at the pivot point to create a mirror image of the pattern. This is called a symmetrical tartan. Some tartans, like Buchanan, are asymmetrical, which means they do not have a pivot point. The weaver weaves the sequence all the way through and then starts at the beginning again for the next sett.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Setts are further characterized by their size, the number of inches (or centimetres) in one full repeat. The size of a given sett depends on not only the number of threads in the repeat but also the weight of the fabric. This is because the heavier the fabric, the thicker the threads will be, and thus the same number of threads of a heavier-weight fabric will occupy more space. The colours given in the thread count are specified as in heraldry, although tartan patterns are not heraldic. The exact shade which is used is a matter of artistic freedom and will vary from one fabric mill to another as well as in dye lot to another within the same mill.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Tartans are commercially woven in four standard colour variations that describe the overall tone. \"Ancient\" or \"Old\" colours may be characterized by a slightly faded look intended to resemble the vegetable dyes that were once used, although in some cases \"Old\" simply identifies a tartan that was in use before the current one. Ancient greens and blues are lighter while reds appear orange. \"Modern\" colours are bright and show off modern aniline dyeing methods. The colours are bright red, dark hunter green, and usually navy blue. \"Weathered\" or \"Reproduction\" colours simulate the look of older cloth weathered by the elements. Greens turn to light brown, blues become gray, and reds are a deeper wine colour. The last colour variation is \"Muted\" which tends toward earth tones. The greens are olive, blues are slate blue, and red is an even deeper wine colour.

Although many tartans are added every year, most of the registered patterns available today were created in the 19th century onward by commercial weavers who worked with a large variety of colours. The rise of Highland romanticism and the growing Anglicisation of Scottish culture by the Victorians at the time led to registering tartans with clan names. Before that, most of these patterns were more connected to geographical regions than to any clan.

A knife pleat is a simple fold, while the box pleat is bulkier, consisting of two knife pleats back-to-back. Knife pleats are the most common in modern civilian kilts. Regimental traditions vary. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders use box pleats, while the Black Watch make their kilts of the same tartan with knife pleats. These traditions were also passed on to affiliated regiments in the Commonwealth, and were retained in successor battalions to these regiments in the amalgamated Royal Regiment of Scotland.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Pleats can be arranged relative to the pattern in two ways. In \"pleating to the stripe\", one of the vertical stripes in the tartan is selected and the fabric is then folded so that this stripe runs down the center of each pleat. The result is that along the pleated section of the kilt (the back and sides) the pattern appears different from the unpleated front, often emphasising the horizontal bands rather than creating a balance between horizontal and vertical. This is often called military pleating because it is the style adopted by many military regiments. It is also widely used by pipe bands.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In \"pleating to the sett\", the fabric is folded so that the pattern of the sett is maintained and is repeated all around the kilt.

Most nesting birds, in particularly Procellariiformes, are now accepted to be jeopardized by \"Rattus exulans\".

Global warming impact on Kiritimati is thus unpredictable. El Ni\u00f1o events seem to become shorter but more frequent in a warmer climate. Much of the island's infrastructure and habitation, with the notable exception of the airport area, is located to the leeward and thus somewhat protected from storms. A rising sea level does not appear to be particularly problematic; the increasing flooding of the subsidiary lagoons would provide easily observed forewarning, and might even benefit seabird populations by making the \"motu\"s less accessible to predators. In fact, geological data suggests that Kiritimati has withstood prehistoric sea level changes well. The biggest hazard caused by a changing climate would seem to be more prolonged and/or severe droughts, which could even enforce the island's abandonment as they did in 1905. However, it is not clear how weather patterns would change, and it may be that precipitation increases.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The type specimen of the Tuamotu sandpiper (\"Prosobonia cancellata\") was collected on Kiritimati in 1778, probably on 1 or 2 January, during Captain Cook's visit.

The single specimen was in Joseph Banks's collection at the end of the 18th century, but later was lost or destroyed. There is some taxonomic dispute regarding the Kiritimati population. As all \"Prosobonia\" seem(ed) to be resident birds unwilling to undertake long-distance migrations, an appropriate treatment would be to consider the extinct population the nominate subspecies, as \"Prosobonia cancellata cancellata\" or Kiritimati sandpiper, distinct from the surviving Tuamotu Islands population more than 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi) to the southeast.", "qas": []}, {"context": "It may have been, but probably was not, limited to Kiritimati; while no remains have been found, little fieldwork has been conducted and judging from the Tuamotu sandpiper's habits, almost all Line Islands would have offered suitable habitat. The Kiritimati population of \"P. cancellata\" disappeared in the earlier part of the 19th century or so, almost certainly due to predation by introduced mammals. While \"Prosobonia\" generally manage to hold their own against Polynesian rats, they are highly vulnerable to the black rat and feral cats. Given the uncertainties surrounding the introduction date and maximum population of the former, the cats seem to be the main culprits in the Kiritimati sandpiper's extinction.\nGiven that the island was apparently settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may already have lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is quite old, was never completely underwater in the Holocene at least, and thus it might have once harbored highly distinct wetland birds. The limited overall habitat diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical taxa, as does biogeography due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several \"Gallirallus\" and/or \"Porzana\" rails make the most likely candidates, given their former presence in the region and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a \"Todiramphus\" kingfisher was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the sacred kingfisher (\"T. sanctus\") group as that species today occurs as a vagrant in Micronesia, and related forms are resident in southeastern Polynesia.

These were both times he was in the area, and, by 1799, Coleridge was able to read Robert Southey's \"Thalaba the Destroyer\", a work which also drew on Purchas's work. It is possible that he merely edited the poem during those time periods, and there is little evidence to suggest that Coleridge lied about the opium-induced experience at Ash Farm.\nThe work was set aside until 1815 when Coleridge compiled manuscripts of his poems for a collection titled \"Sibylline Leaves\". The poem remained buried in obscurity until a 10 April 1816 meeting between Coleridge and Lord Byron, who persuaded Coleridge to publish \"Christabel\" and \"Kubla Khan\" as fragments. Leigh Hunt, the poet and essayist, witnessed the event and wrote, \"He recited his 'Kubla Khan' one morning to Lord Byron, in his Lordship's house in Piccadilly, when I happened to be in another room. I remember the other's coming away from him, highly struck with his poem, and saying how wonderfully he talked. This was the impression of everyone who heard him.\" Byron arranged for John Murray to publish the poem with \"Christabel\" and \"The Pains of Sleep\" along with prefaces to the works. A contract was drawn up on 12 April 1816 for 80 pounds. Charles Lamb, poet and friend of Coleridge, witnessed Coleridge's work towards publishing the poem and wrote to Wordsworth: \"Coleridge is printing Xtabel by Lord Byron's recommendation to Murray, with what he calls a vision of Kubla Khan \u2013 which said vision he repeats so enchantingly that it irradiates & brings Heaven & Elysian bowers into my parlour while he sings or says it\". Coleridge stayed in London to work on the poem and also to try and break his opium addiction. However, not everyone was happy with the idea of the poem's being published, as Coleridge's wife, who was not with him, wrote to Thomas Poole, \"Oh! when will he ever give his friends anything but pain? he has been so unwise as to publish his fragments of 'Christabel' & 'Kubla-Khan' ... we were all sadly vexed when we read the advertisement of these things.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "The collection of poems was published 25 May 1816, and Coleridge included \"A Fragment\" as a subtitle to the 54 line version of the poem to defend against criticism of the poem's incomplete nature. The original published version of the work was separated into 2 stanzas, with the first ending at line 30. Printed with \"Kubla Khan\" was a preface that claimed an opium induced dream provided Coleridge the lines. The poem was printed four times in Coleridge's life, with the final printing in his \"Poetical Works\" of 1834. In the final work, Coleridge added the expanded subtitle \"Or, A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment\". In some later anthologies of Coleridge's poetry, the Preface is dropped along with the subtitle denoting its fragmentary and dream nature. Sometimes, the Preface is included in modern editions but lacks both the first and final paragraphs.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The poem is different in style and form from other poems composed by Coleridge. While incomplete and subtitled a \"fragment\", its language is highly stylised with a strong emphasis on sound devices that change between the poem's original two stanzas. The first stanza of the poem describes Khan's pleasure dome built alongside a sacred river fed by a powerful fountain. The second stanza of the poem is the narrator's response to the power and effects of an Abyssinian maid's song, which enraptures him but leaves him unable to act on her inspiration unless he could hear her once again. Together, they form a comparison of creative power that does not work with nature and creative power that is harmonious with nature.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The poem according to Coleridge's account, is a fragment of what it should have been, amounting to what he was able to jot down from memory: 54 lines. Originally, his dream included between 200 and 300 lines, but he was only able to compose the first 30 before he was interrupted. The second stanza is not necessarily part of the original dream and refers to the dream in the past tense. The rhythm of the poem, like its themes and images, is different from other poems Coleridge wrote during the time, and it is organised in a structure similar to 18th-century odes. The poem relies on many sound-based techniques, including cognate variation and chiasmus. In particular, the poem emphasises the use of the \"\u00e6\" sound and similar modifications to the standard \"a\" sound to make the poem sound Asian. Its rhyme scheme found in the first seven lines is repeated in the first seven lines of the second stanza. There is a heavy use of assonance, the reuse of vowel sounds, and a reliance on alliteration, repetition of the first sound of a word, within the poem including the first line: \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\". The stressed sounds, \"Xan\", \"du\", \"Ku\", \"Khan\", contain assonance in their use of the sounds a-u-u-a, have two rhyming syllables with \"Xan\" and \"Khan\", and employ alliteration with the name \"Kubla Khan\" and the reuse of \"d\" sounds in \"Xanadu\" and \"did\". To pull the line together, the \"i\" sound of \"In\" is repeated in \"did\". Later lines do not contain the same amount of symmetry but do rely on assonance and rhymes throughout. The only word that has no true connection to another word is \"dome\" except in its use of a \"d\" sound. Though the lines are interconnected, the rhyme scheme and line lengths are irregular.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The first lines of the poem follow iambic tetrameter with the initial stanza relying on heavy stresses. The lines of the second stanza incorporate lighter stresses to increase the speed of the meter to separate them from the hammer-like rhythm of the previous lines. There also is a strong break following line 36 in the poem that provides for a second stanza, and there is a transition in narration from a third person narration about Kubla Khan into the poet discussing his role as a poet. Without the Preface, the two stanzas form two different poems that have some relationship to each other but lack unity. This is not to say they would be two different poems, since the technique of having separate parts that respond to another is used in the genre of the odal hymn, used in the poetry of other Romantic poets including John Keats or Percy Bysshe Shelley. However, the odal hymn as used by others has a stronger unity among its parts, and Coleridge believed in writing poetry that was unified organically. It is possible that Coleridge was displeased by the lack of unity in the poem and added a note about the structure to the Preface to explain his thoughts. In terms of genre, the poem is a dream poem and related to works describing visions common to the Romantic poets. \"Kubla Khan\" is also related to the genre of fragmentary poetry, with internal images reinforcing the idea of fragmentation that is found within the form of the poem. The poem's self-proclaimed fragmentary nature combined with Coleridge's warning about the poem in the preface turns \"Kubla Khan\" into an \"anti-poem\", a work that lacks structure, order, and leaves the reader confused instead of enlightened. However, the poem has little relation to the other fragmentary poems Coleridge wrote.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Preface of \"Kubla Khan\" began by explaining that it was printed \"at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, and as far as the author's own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed \"poetic\" merits\". The preface then provided an origin to both the poem and why it was merely a smaller portion of an intended larger work. After reading from Purchas's book, \"The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he had the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two or three hundred lines ... On Awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved.\" The image of himself that Coleridge provides is of a dreamer who reads works of lore and not as an opium addict. Instead, the effects of the opium, as described, are intended to suggest that he was not used to its effects.", "qas": []}, {"context": "There are some problems with Coleridge's account, especially the claim to have a copy of Purchas with him. It was a rare book, unlikely to be at a \"lonely farmhouse\", nor would an individual carry it on a journey; the folio was heavy and almost 1000 pages in size. It is possible that the words of Purchas were merely remembered by Coleridge and that the depiction of immediately reading the work before falling asleep was to suggest that the subject came to him accidentally.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The passage continues with a famous account of an interruption: \"At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purpose of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter!\" The actual person from Porlock mentioned could be many people, including Wordsworth, Joseph Cottle, John Thelwall, Coleridge's wife, or merely a literary device. As a symbol within the preface, the person represents the obligations of the real world crashing down upon the creative world or other factors that kept Coleridge from finishing his poetry. The claim to produce poetry after dreaming of it became popular after \"Kubla Khan\" was published. The person from Porlock later became a word to describe interrupted genius, and the literary critic Walter Jackson Bate recounted that while John Livingston Lowes taught the poem, he told his students \"If there is any man in the history of literature who should be hanged, drawn, and quartered, it is the man on business from Porlock.\" The literary critic D. F. Rauber claimed that the man was \"necessary to create the illusion of the cut short rather than the stopped\". This would have allowed Coleridge to purposely write the poem as a fragment.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Preface to the poem suggests that the poem was not supposed to be printed, that it was a fragmentary work that he was unable to complete, and that the work itself was provided to him through involuntary inspiration. When the Preface is dropped, the poem seems to compare the act of poetry with the might of Kubla Khan instead of the loss of inspiration causing the work to have a more complex depiction of the poetic power. Taken together, the Preface could connect with the first half of the poem to suggest that the poem is from the view of a dreaming narrator, or it could connect with the second half of the poem to show how a reader is to interpret the lines by connecting himself with the persona in a negative manner. The Preface and the poem are different in their locations, as the Preface discusses Coleridge's England while the poem discusses ancient China, but both discuss the role of the poem and his abilities. The poet of the Preface is a dreamer who must write and the poet of the poem is a vocal individual, but both are poets who lose inspiration. Only the poet of the poem feels that he can recover the vision, and the Preface, like a Coleridge poem that is quoted in it, \"The Picture\", states that visions are unrecoverable.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The poem begins with a fanciful description of Kublai Khan's capital Xanadu, which Coleridge places near the river Alph, which passes through caverns before reaching a dark or dead sea.

(lines 48\u201354)\n</poem>", "qas": []}, {"context": "One theory says that \"Kubla Khan\" is about poetry and the two sections discuss two types of poems. The power of the imagination is an important component to this theme. The poem celebrates creativity and how the poet is able to experience a connection to the universe through inspiration. As a poet, Coleridge places himself in an uncertain position as either master over his creative powers or a slave to it. The dome city represents the imagination and the second stanza represents the relationship between a poet and the rest of society. The poet is separated from the rest of humanity after he is exposed to the power to create and is able to witness visions of truth. This separation causes a combative relationship between the poet and the audience as the poet seeks to control his listener through a mesmerising technique. The poem's emphasis on imagination as subject of a poem, on the contrasts within the paradisal setting, and its discussion of the role of poet as either being blessed or cursed by imagination, has influenced many works, including Alfred Tennyson's \"Palace of Art\" and William Butler Yeats's Byzantium based poems. There is also a strong connection between the idea of retreating into the imagination found within Keats's \"Lamia\" and in Tennyson's \"Palace of Art\". The Preface, when added to the poem, connects the idea of the paradise as the imagination with the land of Porlock, and that the imagination, though infinite, would be interrupted by a \"person on business\". The Preface then allows for Coleridge to leave the poem as a fragment, which represents the inability for the imagination to provide complete images or truly reflect reality. The poem would not be about the act of creation but a fragmentary view revealing how the act works: how the poet crafts language and how it relates to himself.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Through use of the imagination, the poem is able to discuss issues surrounding tyranny, war, and contrasts that exist within paradise. Part of the war motif could be a metaphor for the poet in a competitive struggle with the reader to push his own vision and ideas upon his audience. As a component to the idea of imagination in the poem is the creative process by describing a world that is of the imagination and another that is of understanding. The poet, in Coleridge's system, is able to move from the world of understanding, where men normally are, and enter into the world of the imagination through poetry. When the narrator describes the \"ancestral voices prophesying war\", the idea is part of the world of understanding, or the real world. As a whole, the poem is connected to Coleridge's belief in a secondary Imagination that can lead a poet into a world of imagination, and the poem is both a description of that world and a description of how the poet enters the world. The imagination, as it appears in many of Coleridge's and Wordsworth's works, including \"Kubla Khan\", is discussed through the metaphor of water, and the use of the river in \"Kubla Khan\" is connected to the use of the stream in Wordsworth's \"The Prelude\". The water imagery is also related to the divine and nature, and the poet is able to tap into nature in a way Kubla Khan cannot to harness its power.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Towards the end of 1797, Coleridge was fascinated with the idea of a river and it was used in multiple poems including \"Kubla Khan\" and \"The Brook\". In his \"Biographia Literaria\" (1817), he explained, \"I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the parts and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a channel\". It is possible that the imagery of \"Biographia Literaria\" followed the recovery of the \"Kubla Khan\" manuscript during the composition of the book. Water imagery permeated through many of his poems, and the coast that he witnessed on his journey to Linton appears in \"Osorio\". Additionally, many of the images are connected to a broad use of Ash Farm and the Quantocks in Coleridge's poetry, and the mystical settings of both \"Osorio\" and \"Kubla Khan\" are based on his idealised version of the region. \"Kubla Khan\" was composed in the same year as \"This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison\", and both poems contained images that were used in 14 October 1797 letter to Thelwall. However, the styles are very different as one is heavily structured and rhymed while the other tries to mimic conversational speech. What they do have in common is that they use scenery based on the same location, including repeated uses of dells, rocks, ferns, and a waterfall found in the Somerset region. The Preface uses water imagery to explain what happens when visions are lost by quoting a passage from his poem \"The Picture\". When considering all of \"The Picture\" and not just the excerpt, Coleridge describes how inspiration is similar to a stream and that if an object is thrown into it the vision is interrupted.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Tatars ruled by Kubla Khan were seen in the tradition Coleridge worked from as a violent, barbaric people and were used in that way when Coleridge compared others to Tatars. They were seen as worshippers of the sun, but uncivilised and connected to either the Cain or Ham line of outcasts. However, Coleridge describes Khan in a peaceful light and as a man of genius. He seeks to show his might but does so by building his own version of paradise. The description and the tradition provide a contrast between the daemonic and genius within the poem, and Khan is a ruler who is unable to recreate Eden. There are also comparisons between Khan and Catherine the Great or Napoleon with their building and destroying nations. Though the imagery can be dark, there is little moral concern as the ideas are mixed with creative energies. In the second stanza, Khan is able to establish some order in the natural world but he cannot stop the forces of nature that constantly try to destroy what he made. Nature, in the poem is not a force of redemption but one of destruction, and the paradise references reinforce what Khan cannot attain.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Although the Tatars are barbarians from China, they are connected to ideas within the Judaeo Christian tradition, including the idea of Original Sin and Eden. The account of Cublai Can in Purchas's work, discussed in Coleridge's Preface, connects the idea of paradise with luxury and sensual pleasure. The place was described in negative terms and seen as an inferior representation of paradise, and Coleridge's ethical system did not connect pleasure with joy or the divine. As for specific aspects of the scene, the river and cavern images are used to describe how creativity operates in a post-Edenic reality. The river, Alph, replaces the one from Eden that granted immortality and it disappears into a sunless sea that lacks life. The image is further connected to the Biblical, post-Edenic stories in that a mythological story attributes the violent children of Ham becoming the Tatars, and that Tartarus, derived from the location, became a synonym for hell. Coleridge believed that the Tatars were violent, and that their culture was opposite to the civilised Chinese. The Tatars were also in contrast to the concept of Prester John, who may have been Prester Chan and, in Ludolphus's account, chased out of Asia by the Tatars and, in John Herbert's \"Travels\", was Abyssinian.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The land is similar to the false paradise of Mount Amara in \"Paradise Lost\", especially the Abyssinian maid's song about Mount Abora that is able to mesmerise the poet. In the manuscript copy, the location was named both Amora and Amara, and the location of both is the same. There are more connections to \"Paradise Lost\", including how Milton associates the Tatar ruler to the Post-Edenic world in Adam's vision of the Tartar kingdom. In post-Milton accounts, the kingdom is linked with the worship of the sun, and his name is seen to be one that reveals the Khan as a priest. This is reinforced by the connection of the river Alph with the Alpheus, a river that in Greece was connected to the worship of the sun. As followers of the sun, the Tatar are connected to a tradition that describes Cain as founding a city of sun worshippers and that people in Asia would build gardens in remembrance of the lost Eden.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the tradition Coleridge relies on, the Tatar worship the sun because it reminds them of paradise, and they build gardens because they want to recreate paradise. Kubla Khan is of the line of Cain and fallen, but he wants to overcome that state and rediscover paradise by creating an enclosed garden. The dome, in Thomas Maurice's description, in \"The History of Hindostan\" of the tradition, was related to nature worship as it reflects the shape of the universe. Coleridge, when composing the poem, believed in a connection between nature and the divine but believed that the only dome that should serve as the top of a temple was the sky. He thought that a dome was an attempt to hide from the ideal and escape into a private creation, and Kubla Khan's dome is a flaw that keeps him from truly connecting to nature. Maurice's \"History of Hindostan\" also describes aspects of Kashmir that were copied by Coleridge in preparation for hymns he intended to write. The work, and others based on it, describe a temple with a dome. Purchas's work does not mention a dome but a \"house of pleasure\". The use of dome instead of house or palace could represent the most artificial of constructs and reinforce the idea that the builder was separated from nature. However, Coleridge did believe that a dome could be positive if it was connected to religion, but the Khan's dome was one of immoral pleasure and a purposeless life dominated by sensuality and pleasure.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The narrator introduces a character he once dreamed about, an Abyssinian maid who sings of another land. She is a figure of imaginary power within the poem who can inspire within the narrator his own ability to craft poetry. When she sings, she is able to inspire and mesmerise the poet by describing a false paradise. The woman herself is similar to the way Coleridge describes Lewti in another poem he wrote around the same time, \"Lewti\". The connection between Lewti and the Abyssinian maid makes it possible that the maid was intended as a disguised version of Mary Evans, who appears as a love interest since Coleridge's 1794 poem \"The Sigh\". Evans, in the poems, appears as an object of sexual desire and a source of inspiration. She is also similar to the later subject of many of Coleridge's poems, Asra, based on Sara Hutchinson, whom Coleridge wanted but was not his wife and experienced opium induced dreams of being with her.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The figure is related to Heliodorus's work \"Aethiopian History\", with its description of \"a young Lady, sitting upon a Rock, of so rare and perfect a Beauty, as one would have taken her for a Goddess, and though her present misery opprest her with extreamest grief, yet in the greatness of her afflection, they might easily perceive the greatness of her Courage: A Laurel crown'd her Head, and a Quiver in a Scarf hanged at her back\". Her description in the poem is also related to Isis of Apuleius's \"Metamorphoses\", but Isis was a figure of redemption and the Abyssinian maid cries out for her demon-lover. She is similar to John Keats's Indian woman in \"Endymion\" who is revealed to be the moon goddess, but in \"Kubla Khan\" she is also related to the sun and the sun as an image of divine truth.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In addition to real-life counterparts of the Abyssinian maid, Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" describes Abyssinian kings keeping their children guarded at Mount Amara and a false paradise, which is echoed in \"Kubla Khan\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the Crewe manuscript, the earlier unpublished version of the poem, the Abyssinian maid is singing of Mount Amara, rather than Abora. Mount Amara is a real mountain, today called Amba Geshen, located in the Amhara Region of modern Ethiopia, formerly known as the Abyssinian Empire. It was a natural fortress, and was the site of the royal treasury and the royal prison. The sons of the Emperors of Abyssinia, except for the heir, were held prisoner there, to prevent them from staging a coup against their father, until the Emperor's death.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Mount Amara was visited between 1515 and 1521 by the Portuguese priest, explorer and diplomat Francisco Alvares (1465\u20131541), who was on a mission to meet the Christian king of Ethiopia.

Ethiopian tradition says that the Blue Nile is the River Gihon of the Bible, one of the four rivers that flow out of the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis, which says that Gihon flows through the Kingdom of Kush, the Biblical name for Ethiopia and Sudan. In fact the Blue Nile is very far from the other three rivers mentioned in Genesis 2:10\u201314, but this belief led to the connection in 18th and 19th century English literature between Mount Amara and Paradise.", "qas": []}, {"context": "There are many sources attributed to \"Kubla Khan\" for the style, imagery, and topic. As noted above, the description of the size and landscape of Xanadu and of the Pleasure Dome was taken directly from Purchas, who took it from the description of Marco Polo, who had visited Xanadu. Coleridge may also have been influenced by the surrounding of Culbone Combe and its hills, gulleys, and other features including the \"mystical\" and \"sacred\" locations in the region. He admitted that he was directly influenced by Purchas's \"Pilgrimes\", but there are additional strong literary connections to other works, including John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", Samuel Johnson's \"Rasselas\", Chatterton's \"African Eclogues\", William Bartram's \"Travels through North and South Carolina\", Thomas Burnet's \"Sacred Theory of the Earth\", Mary Wollstonecraft's \"A Short Residence in Sweden\", Plato's \"Phaedrus and Ion\", Maurice's \"The History of Hindostan\", and Heliodorus's \"Aethiopian History\". The poem also contains allusions to the Book of Revelation in its description of New Jerusalem and to the paradise of William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". As for specific places, the main character is Kublai Khan the Tartar king from China, the river is Alpheus in Greece and is similar to the Nile, and the Abyssinian woman sings of Mount Amara, and the caves are like those in Kashmir. Also, the name \"Alph\" could connect to the idea of being an alpha or original place. The sources used for \"Kubla Khan\" are also those used in Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Much of the poem could have been influenced by Coleridge's opium dream or, as his friend and fellow poet Robert Southey joked, \"Coleridge had dreamed he had written a poem in a dream\". If Coleridge's dream did originate ideas within the poem, then the dreams are related to those experienced by contemporary opium eaters and writers, Thomas de Quincey and Charles Pierre Baudelaire. It is possible that the dream affected Coleridge's later mood and caused him to enter into a depression, influencing the ideas in his writing that followed the dream night. Of these ideas, Coleridge's emphasised the vastness of the universe and his feeling overwhelmed by how little the universe seemed to him. Also, Charles Lamb provided Coleridge on 15 April 1797 with a copy of his \"A Vision of Repentance\", a poem that discussed a dream containing imagery similar to those in \"Kubla Khan\". The poem could have provided Coleridge with the idea of a dream poem that discusses fountains, sacredness, and even a woman singing a sorrowful song. The poem's use of original names and disorganised use of action can also be attributed to an opium induced state of mind. In terms of spelling, Coleridge's printed version differs from Purchas's spelling, which refers to the Tartar ruler as \"Cublai Can\", and from the spelling used by Milton, \"Cathaian Can\". His original manuscript (as reproduced above) spells the name \"Cubla Khan\" and the place \"Xannadu\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Abyssinian maid is derived from many figures in Coleridge's life, including women who Coleridge admired in some way: Charlotte Brent, Catherine Clarkson, Mary Morgan, and Dorothy Wordsworth. Although Asra/Hutchinson is similar to the way Coleridge talks about the Abyssinian maid, Hutchinson was someone he met after writing \"Kubla Khan\". The person who was the closest match to the figure was Evans, the subject of Coleridge's \"Lewti\". The poem's claim that the narrator would be inspired to act if the song of the maid could be heard was a belief that Coleridge held regarding Evans after she became unattainable to him.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to some critics, the second stanza of the poem, forming a conclusion, was composed at a later date and was possibly disconnected from the original dream.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Before the poem was published, it was greatly favoured by Byron, who encouraged Coleridge to publish the poem, and it was admired by many people including Walter Scott. However, the immediate response to the 1816 collection was to ignore \"Christabel\" and \"Kubla Khan\" or simply to attack \"Kubla Khan\". The work went through multiple editions, but the poem, as with his others published in 1816 and 1817, had poor sales as a result of hostile critics who went so far to attack Coleridge's integrity. Many of the attacks started as a new generation of critical magazines, including \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\", \"Edinburgh Review\", and \"Quarterly Review\", were established at the beginning of the 19th century. The critics were more provocative than those of the previous generation, and much of the bad reception was based on Coleridge's timing of publication and his own political views, much of which contrasted with those of the critics, than actual content. Another reason for negative reviews was a puff piece written by Byron about the \"Christabel\" publication. Not all of the negative comments were public, as Charles Lamb, friend of Coleridge, expressed his fears of a negative response as he wrote: \"Coleridge repeats so enchantingly that it irradiates and brings heaven and elysian bowers into my parlour while he sings or says it; but there is an observation: 'never tell thy dreams,' and I am almost afraid that 'Kubla Khan' is an owl that won't bear daylight. I fear lest it should be discovered by the lantern of typography and clear reducing to letters, no better than nonsense or no sense.\"\nThe first of the negative reviews was written by William Hazlitt, literary critic and Romantic writer. He reviewed the collection of poems for 2 June 1816 \"Examiner\", and, in his analysis, he attacked the fragmentary nature of the work and argued, \"The fault of Mr Coleridge is, that he comes to no conclusion ... from an excess of capacity, he does little or nothing\" and that the poem revealed that \"Mr Coleridge can write better \"nonsense\" verse than any man in English.\" In conclusion, Hazlitt admitted, \"We could repeat these lines to ourselves not the less often for not knowing the meaning of them.\" Following in the June 1816 \"Eclectic Review\", Josiah Conder dismissed the poem: \"As to 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Pains of Sleep', we can only regret the publication of them, as affording a proof that the Author over-rates the importance of his name. With regard to the former, which is professedly published as a psychological curiosity, it having been composed during sleep, there appears to us nothing in the quality of the lines to render this circumstance extraordinary.\" He then continued by focusing on the manner in which the poem was composed, 'We could have informed Mr. Coleridge of a reverend friend of ours, who actually wrote down two sermons on a passage in the Apocalypse, from the recollection of the spontaneous exercise of his faculties in sleep. To persons who are in the habit of poetical composition, a similar phenomenon would not be a stranger occurrence, than the spirited dialogues in prose which take place in dreams of persons of duller invention than our poet, and which not unfrequently leave behind a very vivid impression.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Coleridge's statements on the origin of the poem were considered again by various critics with an emphasis on how the origins affected the merits of the poem. In an anonymous review for the July 1816 \"Literary Panorama\", the reviewer claimed, \"'Kubla Khan' is merely a few stanzas which owe their origin to a circumstance by no means uncommon to persons of a poetical imagination ... It should however be recollected, that in sleep the judgment is the first faculty of the mind which ceases to act, therefore, the opinion of the sleeper respecting his performance is not to be trusted, even in his waking moments.\" The review does praise the work as it continues, \"Still if Mr. Coleridge's two hundred lines were all of equal merit with the following which he has preserved, we are ready to admit that he has reason to be grieved at their loss.\" Another July 1816 anonymous review, for the \"Anti-Jacobin\", discussed the origin of the poem but dismissed the poem with lukewarm praise: \"These have none of the wildness or deformity, of 'Christabel'; and though they are not marked by any striking beauties, they are not wholly discreditable to the author's talents.\" Another July 1816 anonymous review, in the \"Augustan Review\", claimed that the poem's descriptions \"have much of the Oriental richness and harmony\" but also said, in response to the preface, \"There seems to be no great harm in dreaming while one sleeps; but an author really should not thus dream while he is awake, and writing too.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Reviews following months after publication contained limited positive appraisal of the poem. William Roberts's review, for the August 1816 \"British Review\", was more positive than previous analysis but with no detail about the work: \"passing over the two other poems which are bound together with 'Christabel', called 'The Fragment of Kubla Khan', and 'The Pains of Sleep'; in which, however, there are some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery, which we would gladly have extracted if our room would have allowed it.\" The next review came in the January 1817 \"Monthly Review\", with the anonymous reviewer questioning: \"Allowing every possible accuracy to the statement of Mr. Coleridge, we would yet ask him whether this extraordinary fragment was not rather the effect of rapid and instant composition after he was awake, than of memory immediately recording that which he dreamt when asleep? By what process of consciousness could he distinguish between such composition and such reminiscence? Impressed as his mind was with his interesting dream, and habituated as he is ... to the momentary production of verse, will he venture to assert that he did not \"compose\", and that he did \"remember\", the lines before us?\" The review then concluded, \"His 'psychological curiosity', as he terms it, depends in no slight degree on the establishment of the previous fact which we have mentioned: but the poem itself is below criticism. We would dismiss it with some portentous words of Sir Kenelm Digby, in his observations on Browne's \"religio Medici\": 'I have much ado to believe what he speaketh confidently; that he is more beholding to Morpheus for learned and rational as well as pleasing dreams, than to Mercury for smart and facetious conceptions'.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Positive analysis of the poem came from Leigh Hunt, in 21 October 1821 \"Examiner\" when Hunt wrote a piece on Coleridge as part of his \"Sketches of the Living Poets\" series. When coming to \"Kubla Khan\", he pointed out: \"instead of being content to have written finely under the influence of laudanum, recommends 'Kubla-Khan' to his readers, not as a poem, but as 'a psychological curiosity' ... Every lover of books, scholar or not, who knows what it is to have his quarto open against a loaf at his tea ... ought to be in possession of Mr. Coleridge's poems, if it is only for 'Christabel', 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Ancient Mariner'.\" When talking about the poem on its own, Hunt claimed it \"is a voice and a vision, an everlasting tune in our mouths, a dream fit for Cambuscan and all his poets, a dance of pictures such as Giotto or Cimabue, revived and re-inspired, would have made for a Storie of Old Tartarie, a piece of the invisible world made visible by a sun at midnight and sliding before our eyes ... Justly is it thought that to be able to present such images as these to the mind, is to realise the world they speak of. We could repeat such verses as the following down a green glade, a whole summer's morning\". The work went without major notice until John Bowring reviewed Coleridge's \"Poetical Works\" for the January 1830 \"Westminster Review\". When discussing the work along with the origins of the poem, Bowring stated, \"The tale is extraordinary, but 'Kubla Khan' is much more valuable on another account, which is, that of its melodious versification. It is perfect music. The effect could scarcely have been more satisfactory to the ear had every syllable been selected merely for the sake of its sound. And yet there is throughout a close correspondence between the metre, the march of the verse, and the imagery which the words describe.\" When concluding about the work, he declared, \"The elements of this melody are only the common and well-known ones of English versification; our author is always felicitous in their management, but no where has he blended them in so perfect a combination as in this instance.\" Another emphasis on the musicality of the poem came in August 1834, with Henry Nelson Coleridge's analysis in the \"Quarterly Review\": \"In some of the smaller pieces, as the conclusion of the 'Kubla Khan', for example, not only the lines by themselves are musical, but the whole passage sounds all at once as an outburst or crash of harps in the still air of autumn. The verses seem as if \"played\" to the ear upon some unseen instrument. And the poet's manner of reciting verse is similar.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Victorian critics praised the poem and some examined aspects of the poem's background. John Sheppard, in his analysis of dreams titled \"On Dreams\" (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as getting in the way of his poetry but argued: \"It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same\". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to \"Christabel\" and \"Kubla Khan\", praised the poem and declared: \"It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy.\" In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the \"English Men of Letters\", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 \"Westminster Review\": \"Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and listen to these wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Critics at the end of the 19th century favoured the poem and placed it as one of Coleridge's best works. When discussing \"Christabel\", \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Kubla Khan\", an anonymous reviewer in the October 1893 \"The Church Quarterly Review\" claimed, \"In these poems Coleridge achieves a mastery of language and rhythm which is nowhere else conspicuously evident in him.\" In 1895, Andrew Lang reviewed the \"Letters of Coleridge\" in addition to Coleridge's \"Kubla Khan\", \"Christabel\" and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", saying: \"all these poems are 'miraculous;' all seem to have been 'given' by the dreaming 'subconscious self' of Coleridge. The earliest pieces hold no promise of these marvels. They come from what is oldest in Coleridge's nature, his uninvited and irrepressible intuition, magical and rare, vivid beyond common sight of common things, sweet beyond sound of things heard.\" G E Woodberry, in 1897, said that \"Christabel\", \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", and \"Kubla Khan\" \"are the marvelous creations of his genius. In these it will be said there is both a world of nature new created, and a dramatic method and interest. It is enough for the purpose of the analysis if it be granted that nowhere else in Coleridge's work, except in these and less noticeably in a few other instances, do these high characteristics occur.\" In speaking of the three poems, he claimed they \"have besides that wealth of beauty in detail, of fine diction, of liquid melody, of sentiment, thought, and image, which belong only to poetry of the highest order, and which are too obvious to require any comment. 'Kubla Khan' is a poem of the same kind, in which the mystical effect is given almost wholly by landscape.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "The 1920s contained analysis of the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In \"Road to Xanadu\" (1927), a book length study of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Kubla Khan\", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were \"two of the most remarkable poems in English\". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, \"Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing \"modus operandi\" of his genius, in the fresh light which I hope I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself.\" After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, \"with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are like to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space \u2013 that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu.\" He continued by describing the power of the poem: \"For none of the things which we have seen \u2013 dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair \u2013 nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings.\" Lowes then concluded about the two works: \"Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, is an integral part of a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory.\" George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's analysis of the poems \"will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism.\" Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, \"Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' \"finished\"\"\nT. S. Eliot attacked the reputation of \"Kubla Khan\" and sparked a dispute within literary criticism with his analysis of the poem in his essay \"Origin and Uses of Poetry\" from \"The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism\" (1933): \"The way in which poetry is written is not, so far as our knowledge of these obscure matters as yet extends, any clue to its value ... The faith in mystical inspiration is responsible for the exaggerated repute of \"Kubla Khan\". The imagery of that fragment, certainly, whatever its origins in Coleridge's reading, sank to the depths of Coleridge's feeling, was saturated, transformed there ... and brought up into daylight again.\" He goes on to explain, \"But it is not \"used\": the poem has not been written. A single verse is not poetry unless it is a one-verse poem; and even the finest line draws its life from its context. Organization is necessary as well as 'inspiration'. The re-creation of word and image which happens fitfully in the poetry of such a poet as Coleridge happens almost incessantly with Shakespeare.\" Geoffrey Yarlott, in 1967, responds to Eliot to claim, \"Certainly, the enigmatic personages who appear in the poem ... and the vaguely incantatory proper names ... appear to adumbrate rather than crystalize the poet's intention. Yet, though generally speaking intentions in poetry are nothing save as 'realized', we are unable to ignore the poem, despite Mr Eliot's strictures on its 'exaggerated repute'.\" He continued, \"We may question without end \"what\" it means, but few of us question if the poem is worth the trouble, or whether the meaning is worth the having. While the feeling persists that there is something there which is profoundly important, the challenge to elucidate it proves irresistible.\" However, Lilian Furst, in 1969, countered Yarlott to argue that, \"T. S. Eliot's objection to the exaggerated repute of the surrealist \"Kubla Khan\" is not unjustified. Moreover, the customary criticism of Coleridge as a cerebral poet would seem to be borne out by those poems such as \"This Lime-tree Bower my Prison\" or \"The Pains of Sleep\", which tend more towards a direct statement than an imaginative presentation of personal dilemma.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "During the 1940s and 1950s, critics focused on the technique of the poem and how it relates to the meaning. In 1941, G. W. Knight claimed that \"Kubla Khan\" \"needs no defence. It has a barbaric and oriental magnificence that asserts itself with a happy power and authenticity too often absent from visionary poems set within the Christian tradition.\" Humphrey House, in 1953, praised the poem and said of beginning of the poem: \"The whole passage is full of life because the verse has both the needed energy and the needed control. The combination of energy and control in the rhythm and sound is so great\" and that Coleridge's words \"convey so fully the sense of inexhaustible energy, now falling now rising, but persisting through its own pulse\". Also in 1953, Elisabeth Schneider dedicated her book to analysing the various aspects of the poem, including the various sound techniques. When discussing the quality of the poem, she wrote, \"I sometimes think we overwork Coleridge's idea of 'the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.' I have to come back to it here, however, for the particular flavor of \"Kubla Khan\", with its air of mystery, is describable in part through that convenient phrase. Yet, the 'reconciliation' does not quite occur either. It is in fact avoided. What we have instead is the very spirit of 'oscillation' itself.\" Continuing, she claimed, \"The poem is the soul of ambivalence, oscillation's very self; and that is probably its deepest meaning. In creating this effect, form and matter are intricately woven. The irregular and inexact rhymes and varied lengths of the lines play some part. More important is the musical effect in which a smooth, rather swift forward movement is emphasized by the relation of grammatical structure to line and rhyme, yet is impeded and thrown back upon itself even from the beginning\". She then concluded: \"Here in these interwoven oscillations dwells the magic, the 'dream,' and the air of mysterious meaning of \"Kubla Khan\". I question whether this effect was all deliberately out by Coleridge, though it might have been. It is possibly half-inherent in his subject ... . What remains is the spirit of 'oscillation,' perfectly poeticized, and possibly ironically commemorative of the author.\" Following in 1959, John Beer described the complex nature of the poem: \"'Kubla Khan' the poem is not a meaningless reverie, but a poem so packed with meaning as to render detailed elucidation extremely difficult.\" In responding to House, Beer claimed, \"That there is an image of energy in the fountain may be accepted: but I cannot agree that it is creative energy of the highest type.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Critics of the 1960s focused on the reputation of the poem and how it compared to Coleridge's other poems. In 1966, Virginia Radley considered Wordsworth and his sister as an important influence to Coleridge writing a great poem: \"Almost daily social intercourse with this remarkable brother and sister seemed to provide the catalyst to greatness, for it is during this period that Coleridge conceived his greatest poems, 'Christabel,' 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,' and 'Kubla Khan,' poems so distinctive and so different from his others that many generations of readers know Coleridge solely through them.\" She latter added that \"Of all the poems Coleridge wrote, three are beyond compare. These three, 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel,' and 'Kubla Khan,' produced an aura which defies definition, but which might be properly be called one of 'natural magic.'\" What sets apart the poem from the others is its \"verbal enactment of the creative process\" which makes it \"unique even among the three poems of high imagination.\" To Radley, \"the poem is skilfully wrought, as are all the poems of high imagination. The opposites within it are diverse and effectively so. In tone, the poem juxtaposes quiet with noise ... Action presents its contrasts also ... These seemingly antithetical images combine to demonstrate the proximity of the known and the unknown worlds, the two worlds of Understanding and Imagination.\" In concluding about the poem, she argued, \"In truth, there are other 'Fears in Solitude' than that written by Coleridge and there are other 'Frosts at Midnight'; but there are no other 'Ancient Mariners' or 'Kubla Khans,' nor are there likely to be. In evaluating Coleridge's poetry, it can readily be seen and accepted that for the poems of high imagination his reputation is eternally made.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the same year as Radley, George Watson argued that \"The case of 'Kubla Khan' is perhaps the strangest of all \u2013 a poem that stands high even in English poetry as a work of ordered perfection is offered by the poet himself, nearly twenty years after its composition, as a fragment. Anyone can accept that a writer's head should be full of projects he will never fulfil, and most writers are cautious enough not to set them down; Coleridge, rashly, did set them down, so that his very fertility has survived as evidence of infertility.\" He later argued that the poem \"is probably the most original poem about poetry in English, and the first hint outside his notebooks and letters that a major critic lies hidden in the twenty-five-year-old Coleridge.\" In conclusion about the poem, Watson stated, \"The triumph of 'Kubla Khan,' perhaps, lies in its evasions: it hints so delicately at critical truths while demonstrating them so boldly. The contrasts between the two halves of the poem ... So bold, indeed, that Coleridge for once was able to dispense with any language out of the past. It was his own poem, a manifesto. To read it now, with the hindsight of another age, is to feel premonitions of the critical achievement to come ... But the poem is in advance, not just of these, but in all probability of any critical statement that survives. It may be that it stands close to the moment of discovery itself.\" After responding to Eliot's claims about \"Kubla Khan\", Yarlott, in 1967, argued that \"few of us question if the poem is worth the trouble\" before explaining that \"The ambiguities inherent in the poem pose a special problem of critical approach. If we restrict ourselves to what is 'given', appealing to the poem as a 'whole', we shall fail probably to resolves its various cruxes. Hence, there is a temptation to look for 'external' influences ... The trouble with all these approaches is that they tend finally to lead \"away\" from the poem itself.\" When describing specifics, he argued, \"The rhythmical development of the stanza, too, though technically brilliant, evokes admiration rather than delight. The unusually heavy stresses and abrupt masculine rhymes impose a slow and sonorous weightiness upon the movement of the iambic octosyllabics which is quite in contrast, say, to the light fast metre of the final stanza where speed of movement matches buoyancy of tone.\" Following in 1968, Walter Jackson Bate called the poem \"haunting\" and said that it was \"so unlike anything else in English\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Criticism during the 1970s and 1980s emphasised the importance of the Preface while praising the work. Norman Fruman, in 1971, argued: \"To discuss 'Kubla Khan' as one might any other great poem would be an exercise in futility. For a century and a half its status has been unique, a masterpiece \"sui generis\", embodying interpretive problems wholly its own...It would not be excessive to say that no small part of the extraordinary fame of 'Kubla Khan' inheres in its alleged marvellous conception. Its Preface is world-famous and has been used in many studies of the creative process as a signal instance in which a poem has come to us directly from the unconscious.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "In 1981, Kathleen Wheeler contrasts the Crewe Manuscript note with the Preface: \"Contrasting this relatively factual, literal, and dry account of the circumstances surrounding the birth of the poem with the actual published preface, one illustrates what the latter is not: it is not a literal, dry, factual account of this sort, but a highly literary piece of composition, providing the verse with a certain mystique.\" In 1985, David Jasper praised the poem as \"one of his greatest meditations on the nature of poetry and poetic creation\" and argued \"it is through irony, also, as it unsettles and undercuts, that the fragment becomes a Romantic literary form of such importance, nowhere more so than in 'Kubla Khan'.\" When talking about the Preface, Jasper claimed that it \"profoundly influenced the way in which the poem has been understood\". Responding in part to Wheeler in 1986, Charles Rzepka analysed the relationship between the poet and the audience of the poem while describing \"Kubla Khan\" as one of \"Coleridge's three great poems of the supernatural\". He continued by discussing the preface: \"despite its obvious undependability as a guide to the actual process of the poem's composition, the preface can still, in Wheeler's words, lead us 'to ponder why Coleridge chose to write a preface ...

David Perkins, in 1990, argued that \"Coleridge's introductory note to \"Kubla Khan\" weaves together two myths with potent imaginative appeal. The myth of the lost poem tells how an inspired work was mysteriously given to the poet and dispelled irrecoverably.\" Also in 1990, Thomas McFarland stated, \"Judging by the number and variety of critical effort to interpret their meaning, there may be no more palpably symbolic poems in all of English literature than \"Kubla Khan\" and \"The Ancient Mariner\".\" In 1996, Rosemary Ashton claimed that the poem was \"one of the most famous poems in the language\" and claimed the Preface as \"the most famous, but probably not the most accurate, preface in literary history.\" Richard Holmes, in 1998, declared the importance of the poem's Preface while describing the reception of the 1816 volume of poems: \"However, no contemporary critic saw the larger possible significance of Coleridge's Preface to 'Kubla Khan', though it eventually became one of the most celebrated, and disputed, accounts of poetic composition ever written. Like the letter from the fictional 'friend' in the \"Biographia\", it brilliantly suggests how a compressed fragment came to represent a much larger (and even more mysterious) act of creation.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "In 2002, J. C. C. Mays pointed out that \"Coleridge's claim to be a great poet lies in the continued pursuit of the consequences of 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' on several levels.\" Adam Sisman, in 2006, questioned the nature of the poem itself: \"No one even knows whether it is complete; Coleridge describes it as a 'fragment,' but there is a case for doubting this. Maybe it is not a poem at all. Hazlitt called it 'a musical composition' ... Though literary detectives have uncovered some of its sources, its remains difficult to say what the poem is about.\" In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he claimed, \"The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic.\" During the same year, Jack Stillinger claimed that \"Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank \u2013 perhaps no more than a dozen, all told \u2013 and he seems to have taken a very casual attitude toward them ... he kept 'Kubla Khan' in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public 'rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed \"poetic\" merits'\". Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that \"The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of \"The Ancient Mariner\", \"Christabel\", and 'Kubla Khan.'\" He goes on to explain the \"daemonic\": \"Opium was the avenging daemon or \"alastor\" of Coleridge's life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton's Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner \u2013 the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in 'Kubla Khan,' Geraldine's lust for Christabel \u2013 these are manifestations of Coleridge's revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge's countersublime.

However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his \"first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition\", that of \"group composition\", found in Stockhausen's works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career .

Experiences gained from the \"Studies\" made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities . Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new \"statistical\" criteria for composition, focussing attention on the aleatoric, directional tendencies of sound movement, \"the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state\" . Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, \"The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as \"musique concr\u00e8te\", \"electronic tape music\", and \"space music\", entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc; the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space\" (, reprinted in ).

In \"Zyklus\" (1959), for example, he began using graphic notation for instrumental music. The score is written so that the performance can start on any page, and it may be read upside down, or from right to left, as the performer chooses . Still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts.

His main accomplishment in this period was to move key Soviet war industries east of the Urals, so that the Soviet Union could strategically retreat, while keeping its manufacturing capability intact. Frunze's political position adhered to that of the Troika (Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Stalin), but Stalin preferred to have a close, personal ally in charge (as opposed to Frunze, a \"Zinovievite\"). Frunze was urged by a group of Stalin's hand-picked doctors to have surgery to treat an old stomach ulcer, despite previous doctors recommendations to avoid surgery and Frunze's own unwillingness.

When the leadership gathered at Stalin's dacha at Kuntsevo, Stalin shouted at Voroshilov for the losses; Voroshilov replied in kind, blaming the failure on Stalin for eliminating the Red Army's best generals in his purges. Voroshilov followed this retort by smashing a platter of roast suckling pig on the table. Nikita Khrushchev said it was the only time he ever witnessed such an outburst.

His concept of Suprematism sought to develop a form of expression that moved as far as possible from the world of natural forms (objectivity) and subject matter in order to access \"the supremacy of pure feeling\". and spirituality. Early on, Malevich worked in a variety of styles, quickly assimilating the movements of Impressionism, Symbolism and Fauvism, and after visiting Paris in 1912, Cubism. Gradually simplifying his style, he developed an approach with key works consisting of pure geometric forms and their relationships to one another, set against minimal grounds. His \"Black Square\" (1915), a black square on white, represented the most radically abstract painting known to have been created so far and drew \"an uncrossable line (\u2026) between old art and new art\"; \"Suprematist Composition: White on White\" (1918), a barely differentiated off-white square superimposed on an off-white ground, would take his ideal of pure abstraction to its logical conclusion.

Malevich held several prominent teaching positions and received a solo show at the Sixteenth State Exhibition in Moscow in 1919. His recognition spread to the West with solo exhibitions in Warsaw and Berlin in 1927. Upon his return, modern art was falling out of favor with the new government of Joseph Stalin. Malevich soon lost his teaching position, artworks and manuscripts were confiscated, and he was banned from making art.

By that time his works were influenced by Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, Russian avant-garde painters, who were particularly interested in Russian folk art called \"lubok\". Malevich described himself as painting in a \"Cubo-Futuristic\" style in 1912. In March 1913 a major exhibition of Aristarkh Lentulov's paintings opened in Moscow. The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of Paul C\u00e9zanne in Paris in 1907, as all the main Russian avant-garde artists of the time (including Malevich) immediately absorbed the cubist principles and began using them in their works. Already in the same year the Cubo-Futurist opera, \"Victory Over the Sun\", with Malevich's stage-set, became a great success.

Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier.

MacDonald, Fuchs's greatest contribution to the Soviets may have been disclosing how uranium could be processed for use in a bomb.

Fuchs also disclosed the amount of uranium or plutonium the Americans planned to use in each atomic bomb.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Whether the information Fuchs passed relating to the hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded that by the time Fuchs left the thermonuclear program in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951. Soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as the Americans eventually did that the early designs by Fuchs and Edward Teller were useless.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Later archival work by Soviet physicist German Goncharov suggested that while Fuchs's early work did not help Soviet efforts towards the hydrogen bomb, it was closer to the final correct solution than anyone recognized at the time\u2014and indeed spurred Soviet research into useful problems that eventually provided the correct answer. Since most of Fuchs's work on the bomb, including a 1946 patent on a particular model for the weapon, are still classified in the United States, it has been difficult for scholars to fully assess these conclusions. In any case, it seems clear that Fuchs could not have just given the Soviets the \"secret\" to the hydrogen bomb, since he did not actually know it himself.", "qas": []}, {"context": "It is likely that Fuchs' espionage led the U.S. to cancel a 1950 Anglo-American plan to give Britain American-made atomic bombs.

From 1894 onwards, Stanislavski began to assemble detailed prompt-books that included a directorial commentary on the entire play and from which not even the smallest detail was allowed to deviate.\nWhereas the Ensemble's effects tended toward the grandiose, Stanislavski introduced lyrical elaborations through the \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" that dramatised more mundane and ordinary elements of life, in keeping with Belinsky's ideas about the \"poetry of the real\". By means of his rigid and detailed control of all theatrical elements, including the strict choreography of the actors' every gesture, in Stanislavski's words \"the inner kernel of the play was revealed by itself\". Analysing the Society's production of \"Othello\" (1896), Jean Benedetti observes that:\nStanislavski uses the theatre and its technical possibilities as an instrument of expression, a language, in its own right. The dramatic meaning is in the staging itself. [...] He went through the whole play in a completely different way, not relying on the text as such, with quotes from important speeches, not providing a 'literary' explanation, but speaking in terms of the play's dynamic, its action, the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the world in which they lived. His account flowed uninterruptedly from moment to moment.\nBenedetti argues that Stanislavski's task at this stage was to unite the realistic tradition of the creative actor inherited from Shchepkin and Gogol with the director-centred, organically unified Naturalistic aesthetic of the Meiningen approach. That synthesis would emerge eventually, but only in the wake of Stanislavski's directorial struggles with Symbolist theatre and an artistic crisis in his work as an actor. \"The task of our generation\", Stanislavski wrote as he was about to found the Moscow Art Theatre and begin his professional life in the theatre, is \"to liberate art from outmoded tradition, from tired clich\u00e9 and to give greater freedom to imagination and creative ability.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "Stanislavski's historic meeting with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko on led to the creation of what was called initially the \"Moscow Public-Accessible Theatre\", but which came to be known as the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT).

Stanislavski's encounter with Chekhov's drama proved crucial to the creative development of both men. His ensemble approach and attention to the psychological realities of its characters revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage, while Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the text forced Stanislavski to dig beneath its surface in ways that were new in theatre.\nIn response to Stanislavski's encouragement, Maxim Gorky promised to launch his playwrighting career with the MAT. In 1902, Stanislavski directed the premi\u00e8re productions of the first two of Gorky's plays, \"The Philistines\" and \"The Lower Depths\". As part of the rehearsal preparations for the latter, Stanislavski took the company to visit Khitrov Market, where they talked to its down-and-outs and soaked up its atmosphere of destitution.

On his return to Moscow, he explored his new psychological approach in his production of Knut Hamsun's Symbolist play \"The Drama of Life\". Nemirovich was particularly hostile to his new methods and their relationship continued to deteriorate in this period. In a statement made on , Stanislavski marked a significant shift in his directorial method and stressed the crucial contribution he now expected from a creative actor:\nThe committee is wrong if it thinks that the director's preparatory work in the study is necessary, as previously, when he alone decided the whole plan and all the details of the production, wrote the \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" and answered all the actors' questions for them.

He focused on the search for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the characters are seeking to achieve at any given moment (what he would come to call their \"task\").

This perception is reflected in Say's law and in the writing of David Ricardo, which states that individuals produce so that they can either consume what they have manufactured or sell their output so that they can buy someone else's output.
