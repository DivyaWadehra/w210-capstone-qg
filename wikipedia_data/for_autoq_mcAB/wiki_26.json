He completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He took point in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance with the local villagers to aid without discrimination.\nBack in his home in Geneva, he decided to write a book entitled \"A Memory of Solferino\" which he published using his own money in 1862. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe, and people he thought could help him make a change. In addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in Solferino in 1859, he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war, an idea that was inspired by Christian teaching regarding social responsibility, as well as his experience after the battlefield of Solferino.

Another danger is freezing the throat. When a gas that was stored under high pressure is released, it cools abruptly and can cause frostbite if it is inhaled directly from the container. This can occur, for example, with inhaling nitrous oxide. When nitrous oxide is used as an automotive power adder, its cooling effect is used to make the fuel-air charge denser.

Use of glue, paint and gasoline became more common after the 1950s. Abuse of aerosol sprays became more common in the 1980s, as older propellants such as CFCs were phased out and replaced by more environmentally friendly compounds such as propane and butane. Most inhalant solvents and gases are not regulated under drug laws such as the United States' Controlled Substances Act. However, many US states and Canadian cities have placed restrictions on the sale of some solvent-containing products to minors, particularly for products widely associated with sniffing, such as model cement.

There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring , because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was <one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "On the other hand, the Quranic exegete Ibn Kathir, preferred to regard him as a jinni, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, Ja'far al-Sadiq,Al-Zamakhshari and Al-Munajjid, stating in his tafsir:", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command.

However, although he got the outer appearance of an angel, he was still a jinn in essence, thus he was able to choose when the angels and Iblis were commanded to prostrate themselves before Adam. Iblis, abusing his free-will, disobeyed the command of God. Iblis considered himself superior because of his physical nature constituted of fire and not of clay. God sentenced Iblis to hell forever, but granted him a favor for his former worship, that is to take revenge on humans by attempting to mislead them until the Day of Judgment.

In one painting however, Iblis wears a traditional Islamic headcovering. The turban probably refers to a narration of Iblis' fall: there he wore a turban, then he was sent down from heaven.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Islamic traditions are undecided about the exact nature of Iblis. He may either be a fallen angel or a jinni or something entirely unique. This lack of final specification arises from the Quran itself, while Iblis is included into the command addressed to the angels and apparently among them, he is identified as a \"jinni\" ('\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0650\u0646\u0650\u0651') in Surah . This combined with the fact, he himself boasts to be created from fire (nar), suggests that he is not an angel but a jinni, since according to \"hadith\" the angels are created from \"light\" (nur) and the jinn from \"fire\" (nar). But the term \"jinni\" itself is ambiguous. In Pre-Islamic Arabia the term denoted any type of invisible creature including angels known from Arab Christians, Arab Jews and Zorastrians. Additionally, the Quran does not mention \"light\" as a separate source from which the angels are supposed to be created. In Ancient Near Eastern traditions, the nature of angels was associated with fire, therefore Iblis could indeed be intended to represent an angel, such as a Seraphim.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Otherwise, the nature of the jinn in later Islamic tradition is not always clear either. Some hold the jinn to be a sub-category of \"fiery angels\" who are guardians of \"jannah\", differing from the earthly jinn, who are like monsters or demons. Accordingly they are named 'Jinni', because of their relation to heaven. On the other hand, in another story, the earthen jinn themselves are related to angels. Therefore, they were angels sent down to earth to experience bodily pleasure and although they remained obedient towards God during the beginning, they later found themselves lost in wars, bloodshed, and other unjust deeds. Iblis, disgusted from his fellow beings, prayed for his return to heaven until his prayers were answered.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Assuming Iblis was one of the jinn, who differ from the angels, scholars tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by Ibn Kathir, Iblis was once an ordinary earthly creature, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousand of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. To reveal his haughtiness, God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam. But Iblis refused, thus his own nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Other scholars, such as Hasan of Basra and Ibn Taymiyyah, do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels. In this case, his stay in heaven is self explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the Forbidden Tree.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Those scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since, angels do not procreate in Islam, pointing at . Islamic study scholar Fritz Meier also insist, that the Islamic Iblis can not be hold as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition. Otherwise Walther Eickmann argued that the \"progeny of Iblis\" does not correspond with \"progeny\" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis. Actually, according to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is indeed an asexuel being just like the other angels. On the other hand, he occurs as a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, for that he lays eggs, characteristical for Shayatin (demons). The Quran exegete Tabari however, who defends Iblis' angelic origin, asserts, that Iblis did not procreate until he lost his angelic state and became a demon. Therefore, the fact Iblis has progeny could not exclude him from an angelic origin.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Another central argument to determine Iblis essence, also relating to his theological significance, deals with his disobedience. Since angels are, according to Islam, merely servants of God, Iblis' disobedience speaks against his angelic nature, as opponents of Iblis' angelic origin argue. Unlike the angels, he was endowed with the ability to choose, but he decided to disobey due to his own arrogance. His nature to disregard God is thought of a part of the free-will given to jinn. On the otherhand, scholars who adhere to Iblis' angelic nature, do not regard him as \"free\". Actually Iblis is seen as just another instrument of God, a tester who acts within God's plan. It would be impossible to act against God's will anyway. Therefore, his disobedience was in accordance with God's will. Several narratives attempt to explain the reason why he choose to refuse the command, unlike the other angels. According to one, Iblis, as the teachers of the angels, was more knowledgeable than the others and knew about a command, not to prostrate himself, when all the other angels do. In another narrative, Iblis has stolen the secret writings of heaven, therefore he had insight into the future. Knowing about Adams future, he was no longer able to prostrate himself. However, this narrative is more unconvincing, since other angels protested alike, knowing about the corruption. In another explanation, Iblis is endowed with the task to seduce humans, comparable to other angels, such as Gabriel is endowed with the transmission of revelation, and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In some interpretations, Iblis is associated with \"light\" that misleads people. Hasan of Basra was quoted as saying: \"If Iblis were to reveal his light to mankind, they would worship him as god.\" Additionally, based on Iblis' role as \"keeper of heaven\" and \"ruler of earth\", Ayn al-Quzat Hamadani stated, Iblis represents the \"Dark light\" that is the earthen world, standing in opposite to the Muhammadan Light that represents the heavens. Quzat Hamadani traces back his interpretation to Sahl al-Tustari and Shayban Ar-Ra'i who in return claim to derive their opinions from Khidr. Quzat Hamadani relates his interpretation of \"Iblis' light\" to the \"shahada\": Accordingly, people whose service for God is just superficial, are trapped within the circle of \"la ilah\" (the first part of \"shahada\" meaning \"there is no God\") just worshipping their nafs rather than God.

He approaches a peacock and tells him that all creatures will die and the peacock's beauty will perish. But if he gets the fruit of eternity, every creature will last forever. Therefore, the peacock convinces the serpent to slip Iblis into the Garden, by carrying him in his mouth.

Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at Sherborne. Botham developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb through the fence of the Yeovil Boys' Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket.

At the same age he went to matches with his father, who played for Westland Sports Club, and if one of the teams was short, he would try to get a match. His father recalled that though he never got to bowl, and rarely got to bat, he received praise for the standard of his fielding. He joined the Boys' Brigade where more sporting opportunities were available.

Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer. When informed that he wanted to be a sportsman, Botham's careers teacher said to him: \"Fine, everyone wants to play sport, but what are you really going to do?\"\nIn 1972, at the age of 16, Botham left school intent on playing cricket for Somerset, who retained his contract but felt he was too young to justify a full professional deal. So, Botham joined the ground staff at Lord's. As a ground boy, he had numerous tasks such as \"cleaning the pavilion windows, pushing the roller on matchdays, selling scorecards, pressing electronic buttons on the scoreboards and rushing bowling analyses to the dressing-room\". He also received coaching and plenty of time in the practice nets, and was often the first to arrive and the last to leave practice. Despite his time in the nets, Botham was only considered by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) coach Harry Sharp to have the potential to become a \"good, average county cricketer.\" Botham travelled to play for Somerset under-25s a number of times during the season, but failed to excel in any of the matches.

As a batsman, Botham was often wrongly labelled by the tabloid press as a \"big hitter\" (effectively inferring that he was a \"slogger\") but, while it is true that his strength enabled him to drive a ball for six and his courage to hook one for six, Botham actually had a very correct batting style as he stood side-on and played straight: \"Wisden\" praised his \"straight hitting and square cutting\". Botham might not have been good enough to retain a regular England place as a specialist batsman (his Test career batting average was a fairly modest 33.54) but as a bowler who was capable of taking 383 Test wickets, he certainly would. \"Wisden\" praised Tom Cartwright for helping to develop Botham's technique as a swing bowler and, by the time he made his Test debut in 1977, Botham had mastered change of pace, the outswinger and the fast inswinging yorker, all formidable parts of his repertoire which eventually enabled him to break the world Test wicket record.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Writing in \"Barclays World of Cricket\" (1986), former England captain Tony Lewis commented upon Botham's strength, enthusiasm and aggression \"which he took into every game\". Lewis, however, pointed out that Botham's exuberance often reduced the efficiency of his play, in that he would take too many risks or refuse to give up on a bowling tactic despite ongoing heavy cost. He summarised Botham as an exciting cricketer who lacked self-discipline. Botham was in the middle of his career when the book was published but Lewis emphasised the speed at which Botham had achieved certain milestones such as 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. At that time, there seemed no reason why Botham should not go on reaching milestones but he had already peaked and, in retrospect, his career had a meteoric aspect. His rival Imran Khan asserted this when he said: \"Botham was someone who I don't think ever did justice to his talent. When he started he could have done anything, but he declined very quickly. In a way our careers were the opposite of each other. I started quite slowly but got better, maximised my talent. He went the other way, I think\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Because of Botham's natural exuberance, allied to the more outstanding all-round performances of his early Test career and his tendency to court controversy, he became a so-called \"celebrity\" in the eyes of the tabloid press and, as Derek Birley put it: \"for the young he was the great hero (at Headingley in 1981)\". As a result, media hacks ignorantly proclaimed him to be the greatest cricketer England ever had, the world's greatest-ever all-rounder, etc. and this syndrome is still evident in 2017 when a contributor to \"ESPNcricinfo\" writes about Botham \"revelling in his status as cricket's first superstar\". So-called \"superstardom\" is a concept that in fact dates right back to the 18th century in cricket because, in his classic book, John Nyren described Hambledon's master batsman John Small as \"a star of the first magnitude\" (i.e., a \"superstar\"). A century after Small came W. G. Grace, something of a \"superstar\" himself, whom C. L. R. James in another classic book placed among the three most eminent Victorians. In the 20th century, the likes of Jack Hobbs, Wilfred Rhodes, Wally Hammond, Denis Compton, Fred Trueman and Gary Sobers were all \"superstars\" in their day; as was an Australian called Don Bradman.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The tabloid/juvenile hagiography of Botham has caused many knowledgeable commentators to assert that Botham was overrated, a problem for him that dates right back to his first Test series in 1977. When naming him as a Cricketer of the Year in its 1978 edition, \"Wisden\" described Botham as \"a determined character who knows where he is aiming, and who will, quite naturally and fiercely, address himself to the interesting view that he is overrated\". Denis Compton, another great English cricketer who was idolised by the media, dismissed Botham as \"overrated\" and said he \"only did well because all the best players had joined Packer\": i.e., for World Series Cricket (WSC). The point made by Compton about WSC concerns its impact on the Australian team. In 1981 and 1985, their squads to England in the aftermath of WSC were two of their weakest ever, as the Test series results confirm because, apart from Allan Border, they lacked top-class batsmen. Birley countered Compton's point by writing that \"a player can hardly be blamed for the quality of the opposition he faces\". As described above, Botham excelled in 1981 after he shed the millstone of captaincy and he was England's main strike bowler in 1985 but, in 1989, after the post-Packer tide had turned and Australia could put a world-class team into the field again, Botham was made to look ordinary.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Given all the arguments about whether Botham was the greatest or whether he was overrated, it must be stressed that there is no evidence anywhere of Botham himself claiming, Muhammad Ali-style (or even Fred Trueman-style), that he ever was \"the greatest\" or of him \"revelling in superstar status\". Rather, he would readily give praise to his colleagues and effectively assert that cricket is a team game in which he always did his best and played to win (just like Brian Close, his mentor): for example, the credit which Botham gave to his batting partners Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp after the 1974 Benson and Hedges quarter-final against Hampshire; and to Bob Willis who, after all, was the actual match-winner at Headingley in 1981. Botham's innings there was an outstanding performance but, in match terms, it gave England a ray of hope which, without Willis's brilliant bowling on the final day, would have been extinguished for, as \"Wisden\" said: \"This was Willis' hour\".

The Risch algorithm provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists.

This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called \"numerical integration\" or \"numerical quadrature\", arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures (; ; ).", "qas": []}, {"context": "Consider, for example, the integral\nwhich has the exact answer .

Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2 pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.", "qas": []}, {"context": "A better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The trapezoid rule is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2 pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. Simpson's rule approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called Newton\u2013Cotes formulas. The degree Newton\u2013Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to Runge's phenomenon. One solution to this problem is Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature, in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Romberg's method builds on the trapezoid method to great effect.

The Lagrange polynomial interpolating {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at .", "qas": []}, {"context": "Gaussian quadrature often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy.

The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory\u2014a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city.

Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature. The use of classical mythology as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised \"Ulysses\",\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer. Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when Stuart Gilbert published his critical work on \"Ulysses\" in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert.

The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. \"Finnegans Wake\" opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the.\" In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.

Tenniel's work could be scathing in effect. The restlessness in the issues of working-class radicalism, labor, war, economy, and other national themes were the targets of \"Punch\", which in turn settled the nature of Tenniel's subjects. His cartoons of the 1860s popularized a portrait of the Irishman as a sub-human being, wanton in his appetites and resembling an orangutan in facial features and posture. Many of Tenniel's political cartoons expressed strong hostility to Irish Nationalism, with Fenians and Land leagues depicted as monstrous, ape-like brutes, while \"Hibernia\" \u2013 the personification of Ireland \u2013 was depicted as a beautiful, helpless girl threatened by such \"monsters\" and turning for protection to an \"elder sister\" in the shape of a powerful armoured Britannia.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"An Unequal Match\", his drawing published in \"Punch\" on 8 October 1881, depicted a police officer fighting a criminal with only a 'baton' for protection, trying to put a point across to the public that policing methods needed to be changed.", "qas": []}, {"context": "When examined separately from the book illustrations he did over time, Tenniel's work at \"Punch\" alone, expressing decades of editorial viewpoints, often controversial and socially sensitive, was created to echo the voices of the British public.

Engraver Orlando Jewitt, who had worked for Carroll in 1859 and had reviewed Carroll's drawings for \"Wonderland\", suggested that he employ a professional illustrator.

In 1865 Tenniel, after long talks with Carroll, illustrated the first edition of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "The first print run of 2,000 was sold in the United States, rather than England, because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition was released in December 1865, carrying an 1866 date, and became an instant best-seller, increasing Tenniel's fame. His drawings for both books have become some of the most famous literary illustrations. After 1872, when the Carroll projects were finished, Tenniel largely abandoned literary illustration. Carroll did later approach Tenniel to undertake another project for him. To this Tenniel replied:\nTenniel's illustrations for the \"Alice\" books were engraved onto blocks of deal wood by the Brothers Dalziel. These engravings were then used as masters for making the electrotype copies for the actual printing of the books. The original wood blocks are held in the collection of the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

It can be characterized as \"shaded outlines\", where the lines on the side of figures or objects are given extra thickness or drawn double to suggest shading or volume. Furthermore, this style is extremely precise, with the artist making a hard clear outline for its figures, dignifying them and the compositions, while giving restraint in expression and paleness of tone. Though Tenniel's early illustrations in the Nazarene style were not well received, his encounter with the style pointed him in a good direction.", "qas": []}, {"context": "After the 1850s, Tenniel's style modernized to incorporate more detail in backgrounds and in figures.

Referred to by many as theatricalism, this hallmark of Tenniel's style probably stemmed from his earlier interest in caricature. In Tenniel's first years on \"Punch\" he developed this caricaturist's interest in the uniqueness of persons and things, almost giving a human like personality to the objects in the environment. For example, in a comparison to one of John Everett Millais's illustration of a girl in a chair with Tenniel's illustration of Alice in a chair, one can see how where Millais's chair is just a prop, Tenniel's chair possesses a menacing and towering presence.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Another change in style was his shaded lines.

The grotesque is an abnormality that imparts a disturbing sense that the real world may have ceased to be reliable. Tenniel's style was characteristically grotesque through dark, atmospheric compositions of exaggerated fantasy creatures carefully drawn in outline. Often the mechanism was to use animal heads on recognizable human bodies or vice versa, as Grandville had done in the Parisian satirical journal \"Charivari\". In Tenniel's illustrations, the grotesque is found also in mergers of beings and things, deformities in and violence to the human body (e. g. when Alice drinks the potion and grows huge), and a proclivity to deal with ordinary things of this world while presenting such phenomena.

Additionally, Tenniel closely follows Carroll's text, so that see the similitude between the written text and the illustrations.

This physical relation of illustrations to text meshes them together. Carroll and Tenniel expressed this in various ways.

For example, when Alice says, \"Oh, my poor little feet!\", it not only occurs at the foot of the page but is right next to her feet in the illustration.

With knighthood, Tenniel elevated the social status of the black and white illustrator, and sparked a new sense of recognition of his profession.
