The game has been met with mixed reviews from critics over the years. In October 1992, a staff writer of the UK publication \"Nintendo Magazine System\" said that \"Kid Icarus\" was \"pretty good fun\", but did not \"compare too well\" to other platform games, owing in part to its \"rather dated\" graphics. \"Retro Gamer\" magazine's Stuart Hunt called \"Kid Icarus\" an \"unsung hero of the NES\" that \"looks and sounds pretty\". He described the music by Hirokazu Tanaka as \"sublime\", and the enemy characters as \"brilliantly drawn\". Although he considered the blend of gameplay elements from different genres a success, he said that \"Kid Icarus\" suffered from \"frustrating\" design flaws, such as its high difficulty level.

Despite his favorable comments on the Grecian scenery, he criticized the graphics for its small, bicolored and barely animated sprites, its black backgrounds, and the absence of multiple scrolling layers. He thought that the music was \"nicely composed\", but that the sound effects were \"all taps and thuds\". He was dissatisfied with the emulation of the game, as the Virtual Console release preserves the slowdown problems of the original NES version, but has its cheat codes removed. Provo closed his review with a warning for potential buyers: he said that players could appreciate \"Kid Icarus\" for its \"straightforward gameplay and challenging level layouts\", but might \"find nothing special in the gameplay and recoil in horror at the unflinching difficulty.\" Lucas M. Thomas of \"IGN\" noted that the game design was \"odd\" and \"not Nintendo's most focused\". He thought that it had \"[not] aged in as timeless a manner as many other first-party Nintendo games from the NES era,\" and described \"Kid Icarus\" as \"one of those games that made a lot more sense back in the '80s, accompanied by a tips and tricks strategy sheet.\" He complimented the theme music, which he considered \"heroic and memorable\". In his review of the Virtual Console release, Thomas frowned upon Nintendo's decision to remove the NES cheat codes, and called the omission \"nonsensical\".

These were given to the captains directly by the Emperor to reward their efforts in the conquests, and they in turn were to grant benefices to their warrior contingents, who were a mix of free and unfree men. In the century or so following Charlemagne's death, his newly empowered warrior class grew stronger still, and Charles the Bald declared their fiefs to be hereditary. The period of chaos in the 9th and 10th centuries, between the fall of the Carolingian central authority and the rise of separate Western and Eastern Frankish kingdoms (later to become France and Germany respectively) only entrenched this newly landed warrior class.

The chivalric combat was fought when one party's honor was disrespected or challenged and the conflict could not be resolved in court. Weapons were standardized and must be of the same caliber. The duel lasted until the other party was too weak to fight back and in early cases, the defeated party were then subsequently executed. Examples of these brutal duels were the judicial combat known as the Combat of the Thirty in 1351, and the trial by combat fought by Jean de Carrouges in 1386.

In all, 68 women were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments of women are known, although it is said that the Garter was conferred upon Neapolitan poet Laura Bacio Terricina, by King Edward VI. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but this did not occur. Queens consort have been made Ladies of the Garter since 1901 (Queens Alexandra in 1901, Mary in 1910 and Elizabeth in 1937). The first non-royal woman to be made Lady Companion of the Garter was The Duchess of Norfolk in 1990, the second was The Baroness Thatcher in 1995 (post-nominal: LG).

She was also granted a damehood in 1917 as a Dame Grand Cross, when the Order of the British Empire was created (it was the first order explicitly open to women).

From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or breakdancing, a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and \u201cup rocking\u201d (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights. The dancers\u2019 ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group Rock Steady Crew, described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, \u201cwhere the one kung fu master says something along the lines of \u2018hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,\u2019 then a fight erupts.\u201d", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Kuomintang", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Kuomintang of China (, KMT; (also spelled as Guomindang) often translated as the Nationalist Party of China or the Chinese Nationalist Party) is a major political party in the Republic of China on Taiwan, based in Taipei and is currently an opposition political party in the Legislative Yuan.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The predecessor of the Kuomintang, the Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui), was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1911 that resulted in the establishment of the Republic of China.

Ultimately, it is necessary to show compassion toward oneself too in order to share compassion toward others. This \"selfish\" enjoyment of God's blessings but only in order to empower oneself to assist others is an important aspect of \"Restriction\", and is considered a kind of golden mean in kabbalah, corresponding to the \"sefirah\" of Adornment (Tiferet) being part of the \"Middle Column\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, wrote \"Tomer Devorah\" (\"Palm Tree of Deborah\"), in which he presents an ethical teaching of Judaism in the kabbalistic context of the ten \"sephirot\". \"Tomer Devorah\" has become also a foundational Musar text.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Medieval Kabbalists believed that all things are linked to God through these emanations, making all levels in creation part of one great, gradually descending chain of being.

Scholem termed this element of the Spanish Kabbalah a \"Jewish gnostic\" motif, in the sense of dual powers in the divine realm of manifestation.

While the kabbalistic scheme gave a radically innovative, though conceptually continuous, development of mainstream Midrashic and Talmudic rabbinic notions, kabbalistic thought underscored and invigorated conservative Jewish observance. The esoteric teachings of kabbalah gave the traditional mitzvot observances the central role in spiritual creation, whether the practitioner was learned in this knowledge or not. Accompanying normative Jewish observance and worship with elite mystical kavanot intentions gave them theurgic power, but sincere observance by common folk, especially in the Hasidic popularisation of kabbalah, could replace esoteric abilities.

There are two primary models of Gnostic-dualistic cosmology: the first, which goes back to Zoroastrianism, believes creation is ontologically divided between good and evil forces; the second, found largely in Greco-Roman metaphysics like Neo-Platonism, argues that the universe knew a primordial harmony, but that a cosmic disruption yielded a second, evil dimension to reality.

In order to prevent the formation of amorphous silica gels precipitating from supersaturated solutions without reacting with the aluminium or magnesium cations to form crystalline silicates, the silicic acid must be present in concentrations below the maximum solubility of amorphous silica.

A clear distinction was found between areas with good drainage (i.e., areas with a marked difference between wet and dry seasons) and those areas with poor drainage (i.e., perennially swampy areas). Only in the areas with distinct seasonal alternations between wet and dry conditions kaolinite was found. The possible significance of alternating wet and dry conditions on the transition of allophane into kaolinite has been stressed by Tamura and Jackson (1953).

The term \"keren\" (), often translated \"playing to the gallery\", is sometimes used as a catch-all for these tricks. Hanamichi and several innovations including revolving stage, \"seri\" and \"chunori\" have all contributed to kabuki play. \"Hanamichi\" creates depth and both \"seri\" and \"chunori\" provide a vertical dimension.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Mawari-butai\" (revolving stage) developed in the Ky\u014dh\u014d era (1716\u20131735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The \"kuraten\" (\u201cdarkened revolve\u201d) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for \"akaten\" (\u201clighted revolve\u201d), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Seri\" refers to the stage \"traps\" that have been commonly employed in kabuki since the middle of the 18th century. These traps raise and lower actors or sets to the stage. \"Seridashi\" or \"seriage\" refers to trap(s) moving upward and \"serisage\" or \"serioroshi\" to traps descending. This technique is often used to lift an entire scene at once.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Ch\u016bnori\" (riding in mid-air) is a technique, which appeared toward the middle of the 19th century, by which an actor\u2019s costume is attached to wires and he is made to \"fly\" over the stage and/or certain parts of the auditorium. This is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical \"Peter Pan\", in which Peter launches himself into the air. It is still one of the most popular \"keren\" (visual tricks) in kabuki today; major kabuki theaters, such as the National Theatre, Kabuki-za and Minami-za, are all equipped with ch\u016bnori installations.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Scenery changes are sometimes made mid-scene, while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open. This is sometimes accomplished by using a \"Hiki D\u014dgu\", or \"small wagon stage\". This technique originated at the beginning of the 18th century, where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform. Also common are stagehands rushing onto the stage adding and removing props, backdrops and other scenery; these \"kuroko\" () are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible. Stagehands also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as \"hayagawari\" (\"quick change technique\").\nWhen a character's true nature is suddenly revealed, the devices of \"hikinuki\" and \"bukkaeri\" are often used. This involves layering one costume over another and having a stagehand pull the outer one off in front of the audience.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black, red and green, in various order, or white instead of green, vertical stripes. The curtain consists of one piece and is pulled back to one side by a staff member by hand.", "qas": []}, {"context": "An additional outer curtain called \"doncho\" was not introduced until the Meiji era following the introduction of western influence. These are more ornate in their appearance and are woven. They depict the season in which the performance is taking place, often designed by renowned Nihonga artists.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The three main categories of kabuki play are \"jidaimono\" (, \"historical\", or pre-Sengoku period stories), \"sewamono\" (, \"domestic\", or post-Sengoku stories) and \"shosagoto\" (, \"dance pieces\").", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Jidaimono\", or history plays, were set within the context of major events in Japanese history. Strict censorship laws during the Edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited criticising the shogunate or casting it in a bad light, although enforcement varied greatly over the years. Many shows were set in the context of the Genpei War of the 1180s, the Nanboku-ch\u014d Wars of the 1330s, or other historical events. Frustrating the censors, many shows used these historical settings as metaphors for contemporary events. \"Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura\", one of the most famous plays in the kabuki repertoire, serves as an excellent example; it is ostensibly set in the 1330s, though it actually depicts the contemporary (18th century) affair of the revenge of the 47 \"r\u014dnin\".\nUnlike \"jidaimono\" which generally focused upon the samurai class, \"sewamono\" focused primarily upon commoners, namely townspeople and peasants. Often referred to as \"domestic plays\" in English, \"sewamono\" generally related to themes of family drama and romance. Some of the most famous \"sewamono\" are the love suicide plays, adapted from works by the \"bunraku\" playwright Chikamatsu; these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead. Many if not most \"sewamono\" contain significant elements of this theme of societal pressures and limitations.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Important elements of kabuki include the \"mie\" (), in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character. At this point his house name (\"yag\u014d\", ) is sometimes heard in loud shout (\"kakegoe\", ) from an expert audience member, serving both to express and enhance the audience's appreciation of the actor's achievement. An even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor's father.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen, drunkard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only faking his weakness, for example in the character of Yuranosuke in \"Ch\u016bshingura\". This is called \"hara-gei\" or \"belly acting\", which means he has to perform from within to change characters. It is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn, but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor's emotion.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Emotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes, a key element in kabuki. Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions, whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Kesh\u014d\", kabuki makeup, provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form. Rice powder is used to create the white \"oshiroi\" base for the characteristic stage makeup, and \"kumadori\" enhances or exaggerates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks. The color of the \"kumadori\" is an expression of the character's nature: red lines are used to indicate passion, heroism, righteousness, and other positive traits; blue or black, villainy, jealousy, and other negative traits; green, the supernatural; and purple, nobility.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Kabuki, like other traditional forms of drama in Japan and other cultures, was (and sometimes still is) performed in full-day programs. Rather than attending for 2\u20135 hours, as one might do in a modern Western-style theater, audiences \"escape\" from the day-to-day world, devoting a full day to entertainment. Though some individual plays, particularly the historical \"jidaimono\", might last an entire day, most were shorter and sequenced with other plays in order to produce a full-day program.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The structure of the full-day program, like the structure of the plays themselves, was derived largely from the conventions of \"bunraku\" and \"Noh\", conventions which also appear in other traditional Japanese arts. Chief among these is the concept of \"jo-ha-ky\u016b\" (), which states that dramatic pacing should start slow, speed up, and end quickly. The concept, elaborated on at length by master Noh playwright Zeami, governs not only the actions of the actors, but also the structure of the play as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day-long program.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Nearly every full-length play occupies five acts. The first corresponds to \"jo\", an auspicious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot. The next three acts correspond to \"ha\", speeding events up, culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act and possibly a battle in the second and/or fourth acts. The final act, corresponding to \"kyu\", is almost always short, providing a quick and satisfying conclusion.", "qas": []}, {"context": "While many plays were originally written for kabuki, many others were taken from \"j\u014druri\" plays, Noh plays, folklore, or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the \"Tale of the Heike\". While \"j\u014druri\" plays tend to have serious, emotionally dramatic, and organized plots, plays written specifically for kabuki generally have looser, sillier plots. One of the crucial differences in the philosophy of the two forms is that \"j\u014druri\" focuses primarily on the story and on the chanter who recites it, while kabuki focuses more on the actors. A \"j\u014druri\" play may sacrifice the details of sets, puppets, or action in favor of the chanter, while kabuki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor's talents. It was not uncommon in kabuki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day's schedule in order to cater to the talents or desires of an individual actor\u2014scenes he was famed for, or that featured him, would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Kabuki traditions in Edo and in Kamigata (the Kyoto-Osaka region) were quite different. Through most of the Edo period, kabuki in Edo was defined by extravagance and bombast, as exemplified by stark makeup patterns, flashy costumes, fancy \"keren\" (\"stage tricks\"), and bold \"mie\" (\"poses\"). Kamigata kabuki, meanwhile, was much calmer and focused on naturalism and realism in acting. Only towards the end of the Edo period in the 19th century did the two regions adopt one another's styles to any significant degree. For a long time, actors from one region often failed to adjust to the styles of the other region and were unsuccessful in their performance tours of that region.", "qas": []}, {"context": "\nActors form schools or are associated with a particular theatre. Every actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stagenames, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The \"sh\u016bmei\" (, lit. name succession) are grand naming ceremonies held in Kabuki theatre in front of the audience.

These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region. By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall. The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914. In 1915, the school was renamed Kent State Normal College due to the addition of four-year degrees.

Physicists resisted the idea of the reflecting layer for one very good reason; it would require total internal reflection, which in turn would require that the speed of light in the ionosphere would be greater than in the atmosphere below it. Since the latter speed is essentially the same as the speed of light in a vacuum (\"\"c\"\"), scientists were unwilling to believe the speed in the ionosphere could be higher.
