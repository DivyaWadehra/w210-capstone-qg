The copies are not perfect: memes are copied with variation; moreover, they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied again. Only some of the variants can survive. The combination of these three elements (copies; variation; competition for survival) forms precisely the condition for Darwinian evolution, and so memes (and hence human cultures) evolve. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called co-adapted meme complexes, or \"memeplexes\". In Blackmore's definition, the way that a meme replicates is through imitation. This requires brain capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model. Since the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said to be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it. This is to say that the mutation rate in memetic evolution is extremely high, and mutations are even possible within each and every iteration of the imitation process.

Such electrons can therefore easily change from one energy state into a slightly different one. Thus, not only do they become delocalized, forming a sea of electrons permeating the structure, but they are also able to migrate through the structure when an external electrical field is imposed, leading to electrical conductivity.

However, even if photons have enough energy they usually do not have enough momentum to set the ripple in motion. Therefore, plasmons are hard to excite on a bulk metal. This is why gold and copper still look like lustrous metals albeit with a dash of color. However, in colloidal gold the metallic bonding is confined to a tiny metallic particle, preventing the oscillation wave of the plasmon from 'running away'.

The climax to this section is chapter 57, \"Of whales in paint etc.\", which begins with the humble (a beggar in London) and ends with the sublime (the constellation Cetus). The next chapter (\"Brit\"), thus the other half of this pattern, begins with the book's first description of live whales, and next the anatomy of the sperm whale is studied, more or less from front to rear and from outer to inner parts, all the way down to the skeleton.

Second, Ahab's developing responses to the meetings plot the \"rising curve of his passion\" and of his monomania. Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually: \"each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads.\" Bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as \"a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth, as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the White Whale\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Scholar Nathalia Wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines.

None of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared Ahab's monomania; the fate of the \"Jeroboam\" reinforces the structural parallel between Ahab and his biblical namesake: \"Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him\" (I Kings 16:33).", "qas": []}, {"context": "An early enthusiast for the Melville Revival, British author E.\u00a0M.

The theme of race is primarily carried by Pip, the diminutive black cabin boy.

Reward for Pip!'\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Editors Bryant and Springer suggest perception is a central theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down.

How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall\" (Ch. 36, \"The Quarter-Deck\"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in \"The Doubloon\" (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab \"discover no sign\" (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word \"discover\" to \"perceive\", and with good reason, for \"discovery\" means finding what is already there, but \"perceiving\", or better still, perception, is \"a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it\".

Commodified and brutalized, \"Pip becomes the ship's conscience\". His views of property are another example of wrestling with moral choice. In Chapter 89, Ishmael expounds the concept of the fast-fish and the loose-fish, which gives right of ownership to those who take possession of an abandoned fish or ship, and observes that the British Empire took possession of American Indian lands in colonial times in just the way that whalers take possession of an unclaimed whale.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The novel has also been read as being critical of the contemporary literary and philosophical movement Transcendentalism, attacking the thought of leading Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson in particular. The life and death of Ahab has been read as an attack on Emerson's philosophy of self reliance, for one, in its destructive potential and potential justification for egoism. Richard Chase writes that for Melville, 'Death\u2013spiritual, emotional, physical\u2013is the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism, where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self.' In that regard, Chase sees Melville's art as antithetical to that of Emerson's thought, in that Melville '[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self.' Newton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the '[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive.'", "qas": []}, {"context": "An incomplete inventory of the language of \"Moby-Dick\" by editors Bryant and Springer includes \"nautical, biblical, Homeric, Shakespearean, Miltonic, cetological\" influences, and his style is \"alliterative, fanciful, colloquial, archaic, and unceasingly allusive\": Melville tests and exhausts the possibilities of grammar, quotes from a range of well-known or obscure sources, and swings from calm prose to high rhetoric, technical exposition, seaman's slang, mystic speculation, or wild prophetic archaism.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Many words that make up the vocabulary of \"Moby-Dick\" are Melville's own coinages, critic Newton Arvin recognizes, as if the English vocabulary were too limited for the complex things Melville had to express.

Equally abundant are unfamiliar adjectives and adverbs, including participial adjectives such as \"officered\", \"omnitooled\", and \"uncatastrophied\"; participial adverbs such as \"intermixingly\", \"postponedly\", and \"uninterpenetratingly\"; rarities such as the adjectives \"unsmoothable\", \"spermy\", and \"leviathanic\", and adverbs such as \"sultanically\", \"Spanishly\", and \"Venetianly\"; and adjectival compounds ranging from odd to magnificent, such as \"the \"message-carrying\" air\", \"the \"circus-running\" sun\", and \"\"teeth-tiered\" sharks\".

The superabundant vocabulary of the work can be broken down into strategies used individually and in combination.

Second, the use of existing words in new ways, as when the whale \"heaps\" and \"tasks\". Third, words lifted from specialized fields, as \"fossiliferous\". Fourth, the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in \"concentrating brow\" and \"immaculate manliness\" (Ch. 26, \"Knights and Squires\"). Fifth, using the participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words \"preluding\" and \"foreshadowing\" (\"so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene ...\"; \"In this foreshadowing interval ...\").", "qas": []}, {"context": "Characteristic stylistic elements of another kind are the echoes and overtones.

Set over a metrical patern, the rhythms are \"evenly controlled\u2014too evenly perhaps for prose,\" Bezanson suggests. A third level of rhetoric is the \"idiomatic\", and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form. Examples of this are \"the consistently excellent idiom\" of Stubb, such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in a rhythm of speech that suggests \"the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter\".

The extent to which Melville was in full possession of his powers is demonstrated by Matthiessen through the description of Ahab, which ends in language \"that suggests Shakespeare's but is not an imitation of it: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, \"but its two key words appear only once each in the plays\u00a0... and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination.\" Melville's assimilation of Shakespeare, Matthiessen concludes, gave \"Moby-Dick\" \"a kind of diction that depended upon no source\", and that could, as D.H.

Coleridge's vocabulary is echoed in some phrases that describe Ahab. Ahab seemed to have \"what seems a half-wilful \"over-ruling morbidness\" at the bottom of his nature\", and \"all men tragically great\", Melville added, \"are made so through a certain \"morbidness\"; \"all mortal greatness is but \"disease\"\". In addition to this, in Howard's view, the self-references of Ishmael as a \"tragic dramatist\", and his defense of his choice of a hero who lacked \"all outward majestical trappings\" is evidence that Melville \"consciously thought of his protagonist as a tragic hero of the sort found in \"Hamlet\" and \"King Lear\"\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Moby-Dick\" is based on Melville's experience on the whaler \"Acushnet\", however even the book's most factual accounts of whaling are not straight autobiography.

Although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication, Melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions\u2014for instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter \"Cetology\", where he called Scoresby \"Charley Coffin\" and gave his account \"a humorous twist of fact\": \"Scoresby will help out Melville several times, and on each occasion Melville will satirize him under a pseudonym.\" Vincent suggests several reasons for Melville's attitude towards Scoresby, including his dryness and abundance of irrelevant data, but the major reason seems to have been that the Greenland whale was the sperm whale's closest competitor for the public's attention, so Melville felt obliged to dismiss anything dealing with it.", "qas": [{"question": "what was the name of the first book that darwin had a post on ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Literary World"}], "id": "(32, 61, 0)"}]}, {"context": "The earliest surviving mention of the composition of what became \"Moby-Dick\" is the final paragraph of the letter Melville wrote to Richard Henry Dana, Jr. on May 1, 1850:", "qas": []}, {"context": "Some scholars have concluded that Melville composed \"Moby-Dick\" in two or even three stages. Reasoning from a series of inconsistencies and structural developments in the final version, they hypothesize that the work he mentioned to Dana was, in the words of Lawrence Buell, a \"relatively straightforward\" whaling adventure, but that reading Shakespeare and his encounters with Hawthorne inspired him to rewrite it as \"an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions\". Bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume \"that Dana's 'suggestion' would obviously be that Melville do for whaling what he had done for life on a man-of-war in \"White-Jacket\"\". In addition, Dana had experienced how incomparable Melville was in dramatic story telling when he met him in Boston, so perhaps \"his 'suggestion' was that Melville do a book that captured that gift\". And the long sentence in the middle of the above quotation simply acknowledges that Melville is struggling with the problem, not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them.

He became friends with Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and Melville beginning on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend. Melville wrote an unsigned review of Hawthorne's short story collection \"Mosses from an Old Manse\" titled \"Hawthorne and His Mosses\", which appeared in \"The Literary World\" on August 17 and 24. Bezanson finds the essay \"so deeply related to Melville's imaginative and intellectual world while writing \"Moby-Dick\"\" that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be \"everybody's prime piece of contextual reading\". In the essay, Melville compares Hawthorne to Shakespeare and Dante, and his \"self-projection\" is evident in the repeats of the word \"genius\", the more than two dozen references to Shakespeare, and in the insistence that Shakespeare's \"unapproachability\" is nonsense for an American.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The most intense work on the book was done during the winter of 1850\u20131851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed finishing the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: \"What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, \u2014 it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the \"other\" way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches.\" This is the stubborn Melville who stood by \"Mardi\" and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: \"Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould.\" One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Theories of the composition of the book have been harpooned in three ways, first by raising objections against the use of evidence and the evidence itself. Scholar Robert Milder sees \"insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology\" at work. John Bryant finds \"little concrete evidence, and nothing at all conclusive, to show that Melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book\". A second type of objection is based upon Melville's intellectual development. Bezanson is not convinced that before he met Hawthorne, \"Melville was \"not\" ready for the kind of book \"Moby-Dick\" became\", because in his letters from the time Melville denounces his last two \"straight narratives, \"Redburn\" and \"White-Jacket\", as two books written just for the money, and he firmly stood by \"Mardi\" as the kind of book he believed in. His language is already \"richly steeped in 17th-century mannerisms\", characteristics of \"Moby-Dick\". A third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence. According to Milder, the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are \"will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters\", because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters \"can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived\". Buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as \"loose ends\" in the book not only \"tend to dissolve into guesswork\", but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author: repeatedly the book mentions \"the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors\". Despite all this, Buell finds the evidence that Melville changed his ambitions during writing \"on the whole convincing\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Melville first proposed the English publication in a 27 June 1850 letter to Richard Bentley, London publisher of his earlier works. Textual scholar G. Thomas Tanselle explains that for these earlier books, American proof sheets had been sent to the English publisher and that publication in the United States had been held off until the work had been set in type and published in England. This procedure was intended to provide the best (though still uncertain) claim for the English copyright of an American work. In the case of \"Moby-Dick\", Melville had taken almost a year longer than promised, and could not rely on Harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books. Indeed, Harpers had denied him an advance, and since he was already in debt to them for almost $700, he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself.

Three weeks later, the typesetting was almost done, as he announced to Bentley on 20 July: \"I am now passing thro' the press, the closing sheets of my new work\". While Melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set, the corrected proof would be plated, that is, the type fixed in final form.

Melville signed and returned the contract in early September, and then went to New York with the proof sheets, made from the finished plates, which he sent to London by his brother Allan on 10 September. For over a month, these proofs had been in Melville's possession, and because the book would be set anew in England, he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. He still had no American publisher, so the usual hurry about getting the English publication to precede the American was not present. Only on 12 September was the Harper publishing contract signed.

Mesons are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and thus exhibit certain higher-energy phenomena more readily than do baryons.

Yukawa called his carrier particle the meson, from \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \"mesos\", the Greek word for \"intermediate\", because its predicted mass was between that of the electron and that of the proton, which has about 1,836 times the mass of the electron.

It was eventually found that the \"mu meson\" did not participate in the strong nuclear interaction at all, but rather behaved like a heavy version of the electron, and was eventually classed as a lepton like the electron, rather than a meson.

Over the next few years, more experiments showed that the pion was indeed involved in strong interactions. The pion (as a virtual particle) is also believed to be the primary force carrier for the nuclear force in atomic nuclei.

The M16's action works by passing high pressure propellant gasses tapped from the barrel down a tube and into the carrier group within the upper receiver, and is commonly referred to as a \"direct impingement gas system\". The gas goes from the gas tube, through the bolt carrier key, and into the inside of the carrier where it expands in a donut shaped gas cylinder. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gases and thus converts the energy of the gas to movement of the rifle's parts. The back part of the bolt forms a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. It is more correct to call it an \"internal piston\" system.\" This design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The channeling of gasses into the bolt carrier during operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be \"burned off\". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant. Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of Vietnam and was infamous for reliability problems in the harsh environment.

However, the M16 rifle's reputation continues to suffer.\nAfter the introduction of the M4 Carbine, it was found that the shorter barrel length of 14.5\u00a0inches also has a negative effect on reliability, as the gas port is located closer to the chamber than the gas port of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5\u00a0inches instead of 13\u00a0inches. This affects the M4's timing and increases the amount of stress and heat on the critical components, thereby reducing reliability. In a 2002 assessment the USMC found that the M4 malfunctioned three times more often than the M16A4 (the M4 failed 186 times for 69,000 rounds fired, while the M16A4 failed 61 times).

In addition to the new rifling, the barrel was made with a greater thickness in front of the front sight post, to resist bending in the field and to allow a longer period of sustained fire without overheating. The rest of the barrel was maintained at the original thickness to enable the M203 grenade launcher to be attached. A new adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters to take full advantage of the ballistic characteristics of the new SS109 rounds and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. The weapon's reliability allowed it to be widely used around the Marine Corps' special operations divisions as well. The flash suppressor was again modified, this time to be closed on the bottom so it would not kick up dirt or snow when being fired from the prone position, and acting as a recoil compensator. The front grip was modified from the original triangular shape to a round one, which better fit smaller hands and could be fitted to older models of the M16. The new handguards were also symmetrical so armories need not separate left- and right-hand spares. The handguard retention ring was tapered to make it easier to install and uninstall the handguards. A notch for the middle finger was added to the pistol grip, as well as more texture to enhance the grip. The buttstock was lengthened by . The new buttstock became ten times stronger than the original due to advances in polymer technology since the early 1960s. Original M16 stocks were made from fiberglass-impregnated resin; the newer stocks were engineered from DuPont Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers. The new stock included a fully textured polymer buttplate for better grip on the shoulder, and retained a panel for accessing a small compartment inside the stock, often used for storing a basic cleaning kit. The heavier bullet reduces muzzle velocity from , to about . The A2 uses a faster 1:7 twist rifling to allow use of a trajectory-matched tracer round. A spent case deflector was incorporated into the upper receiver immediately behind the ejection port to prevent cases from striking left-handed users.

The weapon could reportedly be carried to the depth of 200 feet (60\u00a0m) in water without damage. The initial Mk 2 Mod 0 Blast Suppressor was based on the U.S. Army's Human Engineering Lab's (HEL) M4 noise suppressor. The HEL M4 vented gas directly from the action, requiring a modified bolt carrier. A gas deflector was added to the charging handle to prevent gas from contacting the user. Thus, the HEL M4 suppressor was permanently mounted though it allowed normal semi-automatic and automatic operation. If the HEL M4 suppressor were removed, the weapon would have to be manually loaded after each single shot. On the other hand, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was considered an integral part of the Mk 4 Mod 0 rifle, but it would function normally if the suppressor were removed. The Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor also drained water much more quickly and did not require any modification to the bolt carrier or to the charging handle. In the late 1970s, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was replaced by the Mk 2 blast suppressor made by Knight's Armament Company (KAC). The KAC suppressor can be fully submerged and water will drain out in less than eight seconds. It will operate without degradation even if the rifle is fired at the maximum rate of fire.
