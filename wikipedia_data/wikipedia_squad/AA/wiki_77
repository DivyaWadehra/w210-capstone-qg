Second, the Convention was a response to the growth of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and designed to protect the member states of the Council of Europe from communist subversion.

At the end of Congress the declaration and following pledge was issued which demonstrated the initial seeds of modern European institutes, including ECHR.

British MP and lawyer Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention. As a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, he had seen first-hand how international justice could be effectively applied. With his help, the French former minister and Resistance fighter Pierre-Henri Teitgen submitted a report to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights just agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate.

The procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex. TMS works by suppressing the inhibition process in certain areas of the brain.

Sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts. The simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. \"What\" and \"who\" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts. For instance, therapists have used sentences like, \"Who is the boy helping?\" and \"What is the boy fixing?\" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object. In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training \"who\" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained \"who\" sentences as well as untrained \"what\" sentences, and vice versa. Likewise, \"where\" and \"when\" question types are very closely linked. \"What\" and \"who\" questions alter placement of arguments, and \"where\" and \"when\" sentences move adjunct phrases. Training is in the style of: \"The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?\" Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Results: Patients\u2019 use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others.

Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings. Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced. Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy.

Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy. FMRI studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area. It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation.

The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of power; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the printing press in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Plato's \"Noble Lie\", concerns expertise.

The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?", "qas": []}, {"context": "Hartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Hartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first. Drawing on a Bakhtinian framework, Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively. Hartelius compares Wikipedia\u2019s methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of Bakhtin\u2019s theory of speech communication, where genuine dialogue is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants. Hartelius acknowledges that knowledge, experience, training, skill, and qualification are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest. Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d. Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary. Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia\u2019s dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges traditional encyclopedias and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production. Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia\u2019s use of hyperlinks to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia\u2019s way of knowing is dialogic. Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the discourse community. The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d. While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue. According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site\u2019s hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias. By Wikipedia\u2019s hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.

With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.", "qas": []}, {"context": "An expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to \"be able to solve\" a problem and an expert has to \"know its solution\".

This was encouraged by the idea that \"elf-shot\" is depicted in the Eadwine Psalter, in an image which became well known in this connection. However, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons. Rather, recent scholarship suggests Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in Scandinavia or the Irish \"Aos S\u00ed\", were regarded as people.\nLike words for gods and men, the word \"elf\" is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not.

In Old English, the plural \"ylfe\" (attested in \"Beowulf\") is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as a people. As well as appearing in medical texts, the Old English word \"\u00e6lf\" and its feminine derivative \"\u00e6lbinne\" were used in glosses to translate Latin words for nymphs.

For a long time, views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, which talks about \"svart\u00e1lfar\", \"d\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar\" and \"lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar\" (\"black elves\", \"dark elves\", and \"light elves\"). However, these words are only attested in the Prose Edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of dwarves, demons, and angels, partly showing Snorri's \"paganisation\" of a Christian cosmology learned from the \"Elucidarius\", a popular digest of Christian thought.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Scholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is V\u00f6lundr, the protagonist of \"V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a\". However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase \"\u00c6sir ok \u00c1lfar\" ('\u00c6sir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the \u00c6sir, or even suggesting that the elves and \u00c6sir were one and the same. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem \"Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice\" and in the Germanic personal name system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word \"elf\" is used in the same way as words for gods. Sigvatr \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson\u2019s skaldic travelogue \"Austrfarav\u00edsur\", composed around 1020, mentions an \"\u00e1lfabl\u00f3t\" (\u2018elves' sacrifice\u2019) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden. There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the \u00c6sir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.", "qas": []}, {"context": "There are hints that the god Freyr was associated with elves. In particular, \"\u00c1lfheimr\" (literally \"elf-world\") is mentioned as being given to Freyr in \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\". Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the Vanir. However, the term \"Vanir\" is rare in Eddaic verse, very rare in Skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages. Given the link between Freyr and the elves, it has therefore long been suspected that \"\u00e1lfar\" and \"Vanir\" are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings.

Much the most popular example is \"Elveskud\" and its many variants (paralleled in English as \"Clerk Colvill\"), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically.

The lead researcher of the 2006\u20132007 study, Terry Gunnell, stated: \"Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations\". Whether significant numbers of Icelandic people do believe in elves or not, elves are certainly prominent in national discourses. They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. In the analysis of Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, \"narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture.

Here Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\" (1590\u2013) used \"fairy\" and \"elf\" interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures. Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the \"Elfe\" and \"Elfin kynd\", claiming that they were created by Prometheus. Likewise, William Shakespeare, in a speech in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1592) has an \"elf-lock\" (tangled hair) being caused Queen Mab, who is referred to as \"the fairies' midwife\". Meanwhile, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and ethereal.

Thus, the \"alf\" found in the fairy tale \"The Elf of the Rose\" by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has \"wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet\". Yet Andersen also wrote about \"elvere\" in \"The Elfin Hill\". The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the \"huldra\" in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.", "qas": []}, {"context": "English and German literary traditions both influenced the British Victorian image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps. An example is Andrew Lang's fairy tale \"Princess Nobody\" (1884), illustrated by Richard Doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree series, and were influenced by German Romantic literature. Accordingly, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Die Wichtelm\u00e4nner\" (literally, \"the little men\"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though \"Wichtelm\u00e4nner\" are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as \"The Elves and the Shoemaker\". This shows how the meanings of \"elf\" had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the house-elf of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories. In his turn, J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form \"Elb\" in translations of his works, as recorded in his \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967). \"Elb, Elben\" was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", repopularising the form in German.", "qas": []}, {"context": "With industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.", "qas": []}, {"context": "As American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" (widely known as \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\") characterized St Nicholas himself as \"a right jolly old elf\".

Thus in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, the modern children's folklore of Santa Claus typically includes small, nimble, green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats, as Santa's helpers.

Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as \"Dungeons & Dragons\") are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well.

People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can.

(An alternative tradition that \"Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote Isaiah, Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes\" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah.) Nevertheless, critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin. The presence of Persian loan-words and Aramaisms points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE, while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when another Jewish writer, Ben Sira, quotes from it. The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the Persian or the Hellenistic periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of Hellenization (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450\u2013330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence; those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330\u2013180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Also unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person.

It belongs to the category of wisdom literature, the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings\u2014other examples include the Book of Job, Proverbs, and some of the Psalms.

He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of Stoicism, which held that all things are fated, and Epicureanism, which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon\u2014a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people\u2014are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical Council of Jamnia in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced then was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion, but other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes. Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book which would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are, for example in the Book of Job. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. \"In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company,\" summarizes Martin A.

At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he \"doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals.\" Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself. One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., \"the dead are better off than the living\" (4:2) vs. \"a living dog is better off than a dead lion\" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11\u201312:7).

Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The first practical oscillators were based on electric arcs, which were used for lighting in the 19th century. The current through an arc light is unstable due to its negative resistance, and often breaks into spontaneous oscillations, causing the arc to make hissing, humming or howling sounds which had been noticed by Humphry Davy in 1821, Benjamin Silliman in 1822, Auguste Arthur de la Rive in 1846, and David Edward Hughes in 1878. Ernst Lecher in 1888 showed that the current through an electric arc could be oscillatory. An oscillator was built by Elihu Thomson in 1892 by placing an LC tuned circuit in parallel with an electric arc and included a magnetic blowout. Independently, in the same year, George Francis FitzGerald realized that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, the circuit would produce oscillations, and, unsuccessfully, tried to build a negative resistance oscillator with a dynamo, what would now be called a parametric oscillator. The arc oscillator was rediscovered and popularized by William Duddell in 1900. Duddell, a student at London Technical College, was investigating the hissing arc effect. He attached an LC circuit (tuned circuit) to the electrodes of an arc lamp, and the negative resistance of the arc excited oscillation in the tuned circuit. Some of the energy was radiated as sound waves by the arc, producing a musical tone. Duddell demonstrated his oscillator before the London Institute of Electrical Engineers by sequentially connecting different tuned circuits across the arc to play the national anthem \"God Save the Queen\". Duddell's \"singing arc\" did not generate frequencies above the audio range. In 1902 Danish physicists Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson were able to increase the frequency produced into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere with a magnetic field, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, the first continuous wave radio transmitter, which was used through the 1920s.\nThe vacuum-tube feedback oscillator was invented around 1912, when it was discovered that feedback (\"regeneration\") in the recently invented audion vacuum tube could produce oscillations. At least six researchers independently made this discovery, although not all of them can be said to have a role in the invention of the oscillator. In the summer of 1912, Edwin Armstrong observed oscillations in audion radio receiver circuits and went on to use positive feedback in his invention of the regenerative receiver. Austrian Alexander Meissner independently discovered positive feedback and invented oscillators in March 1913. Irving Langmuir at General Electric observed feedback in 1913. Fritz Lowenstein may have preceded the others with a crude oscillator in late 1911. In Britain, H. J. Round patented amplifying and oscillating circuits in 1913. In August 1912, Lee De Forest, the inventor of the audion, had also observed oscillations in his amplifiers, but he didn't understand its significance and tried to eliminate it until he read Armstrong's patents in 1914, which he promptly challenged. Armstrong and De Forest fought a protracted legal battle over the rights to the \"regenerative\" oscillator circuit which has been called \"the most complicated patent litigation in the history of radio\". De Forest ultimately won before the Supreme Court in 1934 on technical grounds, but most sources regard Armstrong's claim as the stronger one.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The first and most widely used relaxation oscillator circuit, the astable multivibrator, was invented in 1917 by French engineers Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch.

Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell.

Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, with the exception of the first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The first proposal that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morr\u00e9 and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was made as a way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through \"lipid flow\" from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the nuclear envelope. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some to pass through the membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they play an important role in the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The nuclear envelope's structure is determined by a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the nuclear lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus.

RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000\u20134000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle that is an extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The ER has a central role in producing, processing, and transporting biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations.

Some of Pope Gregory the Great's letters concern the mission of St. Augustine to Kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours. Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). Although no originals survive from \u00c6thelberht's reign, later copies exist. A law code from \u00c6thelberht's reign also survives.", "qas": [{"question": "what is a law code from \u00e6thelberht's rule ?", "answers": [], "id": "(51, 6, 10)"}]}, {"context": "According to Bede, \u00c6thelberht was descended directly from Hengist. Bede gives the line of descent as follows: \"Ethelbert was son of Irminric, son of Octa, and after his grandfather Oeric, surnamed Oisc, the kings of the Kentish folk are commonly known as Oiscings. The father of Oeric was Hengist.\" An alternative form of this genealogy, found in the \"Historia Brittonum\" among other places, reverses the position of Octa and Oisc in the lineage. The first of these names that can be placed historically with reasonable confidence is \u00c6thelberht's father, whose name now usually is spelled Eormenric. The only direct written reference to Eormenric is in Kentish genealogies, but Gregory of Tours does mention that \u00c6thelberht's father was the king of Kent, though Gregory gives no date. Eormenric's name provides a hint of connections to the kingdom of the Franks, across the English channel; the element \"Eormen\" was rare in names of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy, but much more common among Frankish nobles. One other member of \u00c6thelberht's family is known: his sister, Ricole, who is recorded by both Bede and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as the mother of S\u00e6berht, king of the East Saxons (i.e. Essex).", "qas": [{"question": "where was \u00e6thelberht descended from ?", "answers": [], "id": "(51, 7, 0)"}]}, {"context": "The dates of \u00c6thelberht's birth and accession to the throne of Kent are both matters of debate.

Augustine's mission from Rome is known to have arrived in 597, and according to Bede, it was this mission that converted \u00c6thelberht. Hence Bede's dates are inconsistent. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", an important source for early dates, is inconsistent with Bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions. Putting together the different dates in the \"Chronicle\" for birth, death and length of reign, it appears that \u00c6thelberht's reign was thought to have been either 560\u2013616 or 565\u2013618 but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions.", "qas": [{"question": "what is the date of \u00e6thelberht's birth and accession ?", "answers": [], "id": "(51, 8, 0)"}]}, {"context": "It is possible that \u00c6thelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. \u00c6thelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so \u00c6thelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also is possible that Bede had the date of \u00c6thelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, \u00c6thelberht died in 618, this would be consistent with his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Gregory of Tours, in his \"Historia Francorum\", writes that Bertha, daughter of Charibert, king of the Franks, married the son of the king of Kent.

According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and \u00c6thelberht also solve another possible problem: \u00c6thelberht's daughter, \u00c6thelburh, seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at \u00c6thelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Gregory, however, also says that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert.

This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha. On the other hand, Gregory refers to \u00c6thelberht at the time of his marriage to Bertha simply as \"a man of Kent\", and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg's death, which was written in about 590 or 591, he refers to \u00c6thelberht as \"the son of the king of Kent\".

There is no record that \u00c6thelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on the true nature of the relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic, king of Orl\u00e9ans, and Theudebert, king of Metz. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes \"that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand\". It may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms.

Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that \u00c6thelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Regardless of the political relationship between \u00c6thelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods than those of the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so it is not necessary to presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Bede includes his list of seven kings who held \"imperium\" over the other kingdoms south of the Humber.

The anonymous annalist who composed one of the versions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" repeated Bede's list of seven kings in a famous entry under the year 827, with one additional king, Egbert of Wessex. The \"Chronicle\" also records that these kings held the title \"\"bretwalda\"\", or \"Britain-ruler\".

The dating of the entries concerning the West Saxons in this section of the \"Chronicle\" is thought to be unreliable and a recent analysis suggests that Ceawlin's reign is more likely to have been approximately 581\u2013588, rather than the dates of 560\u2013592 that are given in the \"Chronicle\".

If the battle of Wibbandun was fought c. 590, as has been suggested, then \u00c6thelberht must have gained his position as overlord at some time in the 590s.

In Essex, \u00c6thelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King S\u00e6berht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was \u00c6thelberht, and not S\u00e6berht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands.

Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician Hermann Weyl (1885\u20131955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year he created the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation).

This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the Wave equation in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (This was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) When he introduced complex numbers in order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave mechanics was at his feet.

The show, entitled after Cliff Richard's entry for the United Kingdom, was held in Copenhagen, and featured a competition among fourteen of the most popular songs from the last 50 years of the contest. A telephone vote was held to determine the most popular Eurovision song of all-time, which was won by the ABBA song \"Waterloo\" (winner for Sweden in ). The event was hosted by the 1997 Contest winner for the United Kingdom, Katrina Leskanich, and Latvia's representative on its debut at the 2000 Contest, Ren\u0101rs Kaupers.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In 2015, the EBU had decided again to commemorate the contest and agreed with the United Kingdom's broadcaster, BBC, to produce a show for the 60th anniversary of the contest, after evaluating several proposals from member broadcasters in regards to the anniversary celebration beyond the 2015 Contest in May. The event, entitled Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits, took place at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London and featured fifteen acts from thirteen countries in the official line-up. Unlike the 50th anniversary show in 2005 which was broadcast live, this event did not feature a competition and was pre-recorded to be televised across Europe and other EBU members on various dates schedule by the respective broadcasters. The event was hosted by the British commentator for Eurovision, Graham Norton, and the host of the 2013 and 2016 Contest, Petra Mede.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical and political content. For example, on rare occasions, certain countries have been booed when performing or receiving points, especially when being given by a neighbour country. Most recently in 2014 and 2015, Russia was heavily booed when it qualified for the final and received high points. The reason for the booing is considered to be due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and opposition to the country's policy on LGBT rights.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Because the songs play to such a diverse supranational audience with contrasting musical tastes, and countries want to be able to appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes, this has led to the music of the contest being characterised as a \"mishmash of power ballads, ethnic rhythms and bubblegum pop\". This well-established pattern, however, was notably broken in 2006 with Finnish metal band Lordi's victory. As Eurovision is a visual show, many performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, notably elaborate lighting sequences and pyrotechnics; sometimes leading to bizarre on-stage theatrics and costumes, including the use of revealing dress.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The contest has long been accused by some of political bias; the perception is that judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs. According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form \"clusters\" or \"cliques\" by frequently voting in the same way. Another study concludes that as of 2006, voting blocs have, on at least two occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest. On the other hand, others argue that certain countries allocate disproportionately high points to others because of similar musical tastes and cultures and because they speak similar languages, and are therefore more likely to appreciate each other's music. A recent study in presents a new methodological approach which allows an analysis of the whole time-line of the contest (from 1957 to 2017) to investigate collusion and the cluster blocks which have been changing. It allows the analysis to find collusive associations over periods where the voting scheme is non-homogeneous in the time window chosen, and the results show a changing pattern in the collusive tendencies previously discussed. The current research into the analysis of the voting patterns has been used in notable sources, such as the Economist, for investigating whether over 10-year periods such collusion is increasing or decreasing.", "qas": []}, {"context": "As an example, Terry Wogan, the United Kingdom's well-known presenter of Eurovision since 1980 and one of the only three presenters mentioned by name during the contest proper stood down from the BBC One's broadcast in 2008 saying \"The voting used to be about the songs. Now it's about national prejudices. We [the United Kingdom] are on our own. We had a very good song, a very good singer, we came joint last. I don't want to be presiding over another debacle\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Another influential factor is the high proportion of expatriates and ethnic minorities living in certain countries. Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.", "qas": []}, {"context": "To try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote. This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals. However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Cyprus and Greece, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.", "qas": []}, {"context": "An overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. Together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. Result of such a study are presented in. From the analysis it can be seen that countries which exhibit these biases do not receive a penalization from other participants and it presents itself as a means to accumulate more points by establishing these partnerships.", "qas": []}, {"context": "From 2013 onwards, the final and the semi-finals running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the show's producers and then approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group. An \"allocation draw\" occurs for the final and the semi-finals with each nation drawing to perform in the first or second half. Prior to 2013, the order was decided at random (though when the host nation performs is still decided at random, to ensure fairness). There is some statistical evidence that the contest's results were positively related to the running number in 2009\u20132012. The change in procedure was aimed to make the show more exciting and ensure that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar from cancelling each other out. The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans and participating broadcasters. Some fans have alleged that there is a risk of corruption and that the order can be manipulated to benefit certain countries, since the running order is considered to be of importance to the result. As of the 2018 contest, the only regularly contested positions in the running order that have never won the contest are numbers 2 and 16, with position number 21 winning for the first time in 2016. Position 17 has the most victories, with 7. Positions 25, 26 and 27 have not won either, but there have been very few finals with that many participants.", "qas": []}, {"context": "A number of spin-offs and imitators of the Eurovision Song Contest have been produced over the years, some national and other international.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Similar competitions that are still held, include:", "qas": []}, {"context": "\nSimilar competitions that are no longer held, include:", "qas": []}, {"context": "", "qas": []}]}], "version": 1.0}
