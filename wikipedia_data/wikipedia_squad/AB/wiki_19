In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.

All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (\"Lo vedo\". 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (\"Vedo lui, ma non lei\". 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.", "qas": []}, {"context": "There are three regular sets of verbal conjugations, and various verbs are irregularly conjugated.

Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a past participle. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done).

The Earl of Clare observed of landlords that \"confiscation is their common title\". According to the historian Cecil Woodham-Smith, landlords regarded the land as a source of income, from which as much as possible was to be extracted. With the Irish \"brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation\" (in the words of the Earl of Clare), the landlords largely viewed the countryside as a hostile place in which to live. Some landlords visited their property only once or twice in a lifetime, if ever. The rents from Ireland were generally spent elsewhere; an estimated \u00a36,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.", "qas": [{"question": "what was the estimated estimate of ireland 's income from ireland in 1842. ?", "answers": [], "id": "(40, 13, 7)"}]}, {"context": "The ability of middlemen was measured by the rent income they could contrive to extract from tenants.

They would split a holding into smaller and smaller parcels so as to increase the amount of rent they could obtain.

In August 1919, Brugha proposed to the D\u00e1il that the Volunteers be asked to swear allegiance to the D\u00e1il, but another year passed before the Volunteers took an oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic and its government, \"throughout August 1920\".

De Valera resented Collins's clear power and influence, which he saw as coming more from the secretive IRB than from his position as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) and minister in the Aireacht. Brugha and de Valera both urged the IRA to undertake larger, more conventional military actions for the propaganda effect but were ignored by Collins and Mulcahy. Brugha at one stage proposed the assassination of the entire British cabinet. This was also discounted due to its presumed negative effect on British public opinion. Moreover, many members of the D\u00e1il, notably Arthur Griffith did not approve of IRA violence and would have preferred a campaign of passive resistance to British rule.

The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War as potential informers, but there were a number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The IRA divided its members into three classes, namely \"unreliable\", \"reliable\" and \"active\". The \"unreliable\" members were those who were nominally IRA members but did not do very much for the struggle, \"reliable\" members played a supporting role in the war while occasionally fighting and the \"active\" men those who were engaged in full-time fighting. Of the IRA brigades only about one to two-thirds were considered to be \"reliable\" while those considered \"active\" were even smaller. A disproportionate number of the \"active\" IRA men were teachers; medical students; shoe-makers and boot-makers; those engaged in building trades like painters, carpenters, bricklayers, etc.; draper's assistants; and creamery workers. The Canadian historian Peter Hart wrote \"...the guerrillas were disproportionately skilled, trained and urban\". Farmers and fishermen tended to be underrepresented in the IRA. Those Irishmen engaged in white-collar trades or working as skilled labourers were much more likely to be involved in cultural nationalist groups like the Gaelic League than farmers or fishermen, and thus to have a stronger sense of Irish nationalism. Furthermore, the authority of the Crown tended to be stronger in towns and cities than in the countryside and as such those engaged in Irish nationalist activities in urban areas were much more likely to come into conflict with the Crown, thus leading to a greater chance of radicalisation. Finally, the British tactic of blowing up the homes of IRA members had the effect of discouraging many farmers from joining the struggle as the destruction of the family farm could easily reduce a farmer and his family to destitution. Of the \"active\" IRA members, three-quarters were in their late teens or early 20s and only 5% of the \"active\" men were in the age range of 40 or older. The \"active\" members were overwhelmingly single men with only 4% being married or engaged in a relationship. The life of an \"active\" IRA man with its stress of living on the run and constantly being in hiding tended to attract single men who could adjust to this lifestyle far more easily than a man in a relationship. Furthermore, the IRA preferred to recruit single men as it was found that singles could devote themselves more wholeheartedly to the struggle.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Women were active in the republican movement, but almost no women fought with the IRA whose \"active\" members were almost entirely male. The IRA was not a sectarian group and went out of its way to proclaim it was open to all Irishmen, but its membership was largely Catholic with virtually no Protestants serving as \"active\" IRA men. Hart wrote that in his study of the IRA membership that he found only three Protestants serving as \"active\" IRA men between 1919 and 1921. Of the 917 IRA men convicted by British courts under the Defence of the Realm Act in 1919, only one was a Protestant. The majority of those serving in the IRA were practicing Catholics, but there was a large minority of \"pagans\" as atheists or non-practicing Catholics were known in Ireland. The majority of the IRA men serving in metropolitan Britain were permanent residents with very few sent over from Ireland.

The most intense period of the war was from November 1920 onwards. The IRA campaign can broadly be split into three phases. The first, in 1919, involved the re-organisation of the Irish Volunteers as a guerrilla army and only sporadic attacks. Organisers such as Ernie O'Malley were sent around the country to set up viable guerrilla units. On paper, there were 100,000 or so Volunteers enrolled after the conscription crisis of 1918. However, only about 15,000 of these participated in the guerrilla war. In 1919, Collins, the IRA's Director of Intelligence, organised the \"Squad\"\u2014an assassination unit based in Dublin which killed police involved in intelligence work (the Irish playwright Brendan Behan's father Stephen Behan was a member of the Squad). Typical of Collins's sardonic sense of humour, the Squad was often referred to as his \"Twelve Apostles\". In addition, there were some arms raids on RIC barracks. By the end of 1919, four Dublin Metropolitan Police and 11 RIC men had been killed. The RIC abandoned most of their smaller rural barracks in late 1919. Around 400 of these were burned in a co-ordinated IRA operation around the country in April 1920.", "qas": [{"question": "who fought against the crown forces in ireland between 1917 and 1924 ?", "answers": [], "id": "(45, 8, 0)"}]}, {"context": "The second phase of the IRA campaign, roughly from January to July 1920, involved attacks on the fortified police barracks located in the towns.

Firstly, the British declared martial law in parts of the country\u2014allowing for internment and executions of IRA men. Secondly they deployed paramilitary forces, the Black and Tans and Auxiliary Division, and more British Army personnel into the country. Thus, the third phase of the war (roughly August 1920 \u2013 July 1921) involved the IRA taking on a greatly expanded British force, moving away from attacking well-defended barracks and instead using ambush tactics. To this end the IRA was re-organised into \"flying columns\"\u2014permanent guerrilla units, usually about 20 strong, although sometimes larger. In rural areas, the flying columns usually had bases in remote mountainous areas.", "qas": []}, {"context": "While most areas of the country saw some violence in 1919\u20131921, the brunt of the war was fought in Dublin and the southern province of Munster.

At the Crossbarry Ambush in March 1921, 100 or so of Barry's men fought a sizeable engagement with a British column of 1,200, escaping from the British encircling manoeuvre. In Dublin, the \"Squad\" and elements of the IRA Dublin Brigade were amalgamated into the \"Active Service Unit\", under Oscar Traynor, which tried to carry out at least three attacks on British troops a day. Usually, these consisted of shooting or grenade attacks on British patrols. Outside Dublin and Munster, there were only isolated areas of intense activity. For instance, the County Longford IRA under Se\u00e1n Mac Eoin carried out a number of well planned ambushes and successfully defended the village of Ballinalee against Black and Tan reprisals in a three-hour gun battle.

The IRA in Belfast and the north generally, although involved in protecting the Catholic community from loyalists and state forces, undertook an arson campaign against factories and commercial premises.

An ambitious plan to buy arms from Italy in 1921 collapsed when the money did not reach the arms dealers.

The average adult human contains about 0.005% body weight of iron, or about four grams, of which three quarters is in hemoglobin \u2013 a level that remains constant despite only about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day, because the human body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH.

At the bone marrow, transferrin is reduced from Fe and Fe and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The most commonly known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds (biological iron molecules) are the heme proteins: examples are hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome P450.

Some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin. Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as catalase, lipoxygenases, and IRE-BP.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in red blood cells and contributes their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, generating energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe ion at the center of the heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe ion about 55\u00a0picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.", "qas": []}, {"context": "When deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe\u2013O\u2013O bond angle of around 120\u00b0 that avoids the formation of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe or Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe to Fe, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue. As described by the Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Carbon monoxide and phosphorus trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but with much more strength, so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body. Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide, but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a. The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen \u2013 with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide. Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:", "qas": []}, {"context": "Although the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The ability of sea mussels to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles.

Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line.

Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one. The stable indium isotope, indium-113, is one of the p-nuclei, the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made directly in the s- and r-processes (rapid neutron capture), and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight quadrillion years, this cannot account for all indium-113.", "qas": [{"question": "what is the stable indium isotope ?", "answers": [], "id": "(54, 17, 4)"}]}, {"context": "Indium is the 68th most abundant element in Earth's crust at approximately 50 ppb.
