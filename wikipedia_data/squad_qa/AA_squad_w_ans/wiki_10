Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing Battle of Edington which may have been fought near Westbury, Wiltshire.

Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester. The formal Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, preserved in Old English in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (Manuscript 383), and in a Latin compilation known as \"Quadripartitus\", was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King Ceolwulf II of Mercia was deposed.", "qas": []}, {"context": "That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia.

Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of Rochester where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city.

The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again. Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law \u00c6thelred, ealdorman of Mercia.

One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in Hadleigh, Suffolk.\nGuthrum's passing changed the political landscape for Alfred.

The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at Cwatbridge near Bridgnorth. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.\nAccording to the law code of King Ine of Wessex, issued in about 694:\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a shield wall, advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.", "qas": []}, {"context": "These bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, ramparts and palisades. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.", "qas": []}, {"context": "With these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with Charles the Bald and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair.

The \"hide\" was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A \"hide\" is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The \"hide\" would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many \"hides\" he owned.", "qas": []}, {"context": "At the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of \"burhs\", distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom. There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred's burhs (later termed \"boroughs\") ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden revetments and palisades, such as at Burpham in West Sussex. The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.", "qas": []}, {"context": "A contemporary document now known as the \"Burghal Hidage\" provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the \"hidage\" for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining of wall. A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system-wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by Charles the Bald a generation before. The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.\nThe burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use (known as \"herepaths\"). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader. This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders. The Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of siegecraft, having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well-maintained army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces. Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892, and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in Kent, the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution.

In 896 he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. King Athelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships, and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Nevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of Greek and Roman warships, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two. Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out. A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them. But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at Selsey Bill). The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long \"domboc\" or law code consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"synod-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or Offa, king of the Mercians, or King \u00c6thelberht of Kent who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian Patrick Wormald to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.", "qas": []}, {"context": "About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the Ten Commandments, a few chapters from the Book of Exodus, and the Apostolic Letter from the Acts of the Apostles (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law. It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Similarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law. The link between Mosaic law and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\". Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.", "qas": []}, {"context": "When one turns from the \"domboc\"'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted the laws of Ine that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\". In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\". A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Asser represents Alfred as a Solomonic judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England, whereas Asser's \"The Life of King Alfred\" promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available. His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius. He corresponded with Elias III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the Pope were fairly frequent. Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of Britain are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the southern Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them from North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign the North Welsh followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"Scots\" (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint Modwenna may show Alfred's interest in that island.", "qas": []}, {"context": "In the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the burhs, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of Charlemagne almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.

The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.

Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.", "qas": []}, {"context": "He was equally comfortable distributing his translation of Gregory the Great's \"Pastoral Care\" to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges.

Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's \"Pastoral Care\" that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\". Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.

He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction.

Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.", "qas": []}, {"context": "There were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\". It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Apart from the lost \"Handboc\" or \"Encheiridio\", which seems to have been a commonplace book kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the \"Dialogues\" of Gregory the Great, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by Werferth, Bishop of Worcester, with the king merely furnishing a preface. Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's \"Pastoral Care\", Boethius's \"Consolation of Philosophy\", St. Augustine's \"Soliloquies\" and the first fifty psalms of the Psalter.", "qas": []}, {"context": "One might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the Vulgate Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of Orosius's \"Histories against the Pagans\" and Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\" are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's \"Leechbook\" and the anonymous \"Old English Martyrology\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "The preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's \"Pastoral Care\" explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops. Interest in Alfred's translation of \"Pastoral Care\" was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Boethius's \"Consolation of Philosophy\" was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the \"Pastoral Care\" the Alfredian text deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\" The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the writing is prose, in the other a combination of prose and alliterating verse.

The first half is based mainly on the \"Soliloquies\" of St Augustine of Hippo, the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\" Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem \"The Owl and the Nightingale\" where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. \"The Proverbs of Alfred\", a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The Alfred jewel, discovered in Somerset in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its Old English inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made').

As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's \"Pastoral Care\", kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been.

A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected.

For nearly a decade, Algardi struggled for recognition. In Rome he was aided by friends that included Pietro da Cortona and his fellow Bolognese, Domenichino. His early Roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts, while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes. In the 1630s he worked on the tombs of the Mellini family in the Mellini Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo.\nAlgardi's first major commission came about in 1634, when Cardinal Ubaldini (Medici) contracted for a funeral monument for his great-uncle, Pope Leo XI, the third of the Medici popes, who had reigned for less than a month in 1605. The monument was started in 1640, and mostly completed by 1644. The arrangement mirrors the one designed by Bernini for the Tomb of Urban VIII (1628\u201347), with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing, while at his feet, two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus. However, in Bernini's tomb, the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below, wherein the figures of \"Charity\" and \"Justice\" are either distracted by \"putti\" or lost in contemplation, while skeletal \"Death\" actively writes the epitaph. Algardi's tomb is much less dynamic. The allegorical figures of \"Magnanimity\" and \"Liberality\" have an impassive, ethereal dignity. Some have identified the helmeted figure of \"Magnanimity\" with that of Athena and iconic images of \"Wisdom\". \"Liberality\" resembles Duquesnoy's famous \"Santa Susanna\", but rendered more elegant.

The first theory, the emission theory, was supported by such thinkers as Euclid and Ptolemy, who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by Aristotle and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as al-Kindi) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the \"Book of Optics\" was from Ptolemy's \"Optics\", while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account. Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of Galen, and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\". This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye. He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object\u2014for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved. He later asserted (in book seven of the \"Optics\") that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived \"as if\" perpendicular.", "qas": [{"question": "how many of the `` lasers '' did he have ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "seven"}], "id": "(5, 7, 12)"}]}, {"context": "His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why \"only\" perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?

For example, he described what became in the 19th century Hering's law of equal innervation.

Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law. In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy. In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune and Sabra, Raynaud showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-M\u00fcller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.\nAlhazen's most original contribution was that, after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system. His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye, which he sought to avoid. He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye. He followed Galen in believing that the lens was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the retina was also involved.", "qas": [{"question": "what did alhazen study ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the process of sight"}], "id": "(5, 11, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.", "qas": []}, {"context": "An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (\"i'tibar\")(Arabic: \u0625\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631) and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries. Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (\"ilm tabi'i\") with mathematics (\"ta'alim\"; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in \"Kitab al-Manazir\" (\"The Optics\"; \"De aspectibus\" or \"Perspectivae\") and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen \"was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.\" G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view, arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his \"Book of Optics\" had not yet been fully translated from Arabic. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the circumference and making equal angles with the normal at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an equation of the fourth degree. This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of fourth powers, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an integration, where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid. Alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic sections and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used Descartes' analytical methods to analyse the problem, with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician Peter M. Neumann. Recently, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors. They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six. Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.", "qas": [{"question": "what is the name of the book of the book of philips ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Book V of the Book of Optics"}], "id": "(5, 16, 0)"}]}, {"context": " The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that only the impact of perpendicular projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect oblique projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not. He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones.

Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky.

He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by Roger Bacon, John Pecham and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century. Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it.

Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso \"el Africano\" (\"the African\"). Alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch, and supported the Africanists who wanted to conquer for Spain a new empire in Africa to compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and Asia. The Rif War had starkly polarized Spanish society between the Africanists who wanted to conquer an empire in Africa vs. the \"abandonistas\" who wanted to abandon Morocco as not worth the blood and treasure. Alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals, and one of his most favored generals was Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Silvestre. In 1921, when Silvestre advanced up into the Rif mountains of Morocco, Alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read \"Hurrah for real men!\", urging Silvestre not to retreat at a time when Silvestre was experiencing major difficulties. Silvestre stayed the course, leading his men into the Battle of Annual, one of Spain's worst defeats. Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the \"Disaster of the Annual\" while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say \"Chicken meat is cheap\", before resuming his game of golf. Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the \"Disaster of the Annual\", which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King couldn't care less about the lives of his soldiers.

Archaeology has detected human activity from the earliest Iron Age, BC. \nThe city's legendary founder was Cinyras, linked with the birth of Adonis, who called the city after his mother Amathous. According to a version of the Ariadne legend noted by Plutarch, Theseus abandoned Ariadne at Amathousa, where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb. According to Plutarch's source, Amathousians called the sacred grove where her shrine was situated the Wood of Aphrodite Ariadne. More purely Hellenic myth would have Amathus settled instead by one of the sons of Heracles, thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there.\nIt was said in antiquity that the people of Amathus were autochthonous, or \"Pelasgian\". Their non-Greek language is confirmed on the site by Eteocypriot inscriptions in the Cypriot syllabary which alone in the Aegean world survived the Bronze Age collapse and continued to be used down to the 4th century BC.\nAmathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbour and flourished at an early date, soon requiring several cemeteries. Greeks from Euboea left their pottery at Amathus from the 10th century BC. During the post-Phoenician era of the 8th century BC, a palace was erected and a port was also constructed, which served the trade with the Greeks and the Levantines. A special burial ground for infants, a \"tophet\" served the culture of the Phoenicians. For the Hellenes, high on the cliff a temple was built, which became a worship site devoted to Aphrodite, in her particular local presence as \"Aphrodite Amathusia\" along with a bearded male Aphrodite called \"Aphroditos\". The excavators discovered the final stage of the Temple of Aphrodite, also known as Aphrodisias, which dates approximately to the 1st century BC. According to the legend, it was where festive Adonia took place, in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions; they also competed in dancing and singing, all to the honour of Adonis.\nThe earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early Iron Age period of Graeco-Phoenician influences (1000-600 BC). Amathus is identified with \"Kartihadasti\" (Phoenician \"New-Town\") in the Cypriote tribute-list of Esarhaddon of Assyria (668 BC). It certainly maintained strong Phoenician sympathies, for it was its refusal to join the philhellene league of Onesilos of Salamis which provoked the revolt of Cyprus from Achaemenid Persia in 500-494 BC, when Amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of Onesilos.

If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp.

Roman military tribunes (\"tribuni militum\"), senior officers in Roman legions, wore a similar purple band so the reference may be to a family background of military leadership. The tradition was old as the togas and pallia of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band. In the church \"the purple\" is a euphemism for blood and therefore \"wearing the purple\" may be a reference to martyrdom or a bishop's robe. In addition, in the later Roman Empire both Roman consuls and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe. The \"Notitia Dignitatum\", a Roman catalogue of official posts, lists four or five provincial governors in Roman Britain and two of them were of consular rank.

Ashley suggests that Ambrosius Aurelianus was related to the two Aurelii Ambrosii. Tim Venning points out that the name \"Aurelianus\" could be the result of a Roman adoption. When a boy was adopted into a new gens (clan), he received the family names of his new family, plus an additional cognomen indicating his descent from his original gens/family. The additional cognomen often had the form \"-anus\". When Gaius Octavius from gens Octavia was adopted into the Julii Caesares family, his new name became Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus.

It was essential to the philosophy of Gildas that Briton leaders who achieved victory over the barbarians were only able to do so because of divine aid. And only those who had superior Christian virtues were deserving of this aid. Ambrosius Aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians.

His name \"Aurelius\" suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname \"Caninus\" was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named Conan/Cynan/Kenan. Some identify him with Cynan Garwyn, a 6th-century King of Powys, though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him. Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in Brittany. Caninus, in this view, might be Conomor (\"Great Dog\"). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas.

The later timeline from the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts and the P\u0101li \"Therag\u0101th\u0101\", however, have \u0100nanda ordain much later, about twenty-five years before the Buddha's deathin other words, twenty years in the Buddha's ministry. Some Sanskrit sources have him ordain even later. The M\u016bladarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts on monastic discipline (P\u0101li and ) relate that soothsayers predict \u0100nanda will be the Buddha's attendant. In order to prevent \u0100nanda from leaving the palace to ordain, his father brings him to Ves\u0101l\u012b () during the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, but the Buddha meets and teaches \u0100nanda later. When \u0100nanda does become ordained, his father has him ordain in Kapilavatthu in the Nigrodh\u0101r\u0101ma monastery () with much ceremony, \u0100nanda's preceptor (; ) being a certain Da\u015bab\u0101la K\u0101\u015byapa. The Mah\u0101vastu relates that M\u1e5bg\u012b is initially opposed to \u0100nanda joining the holy life, because his brother Devadatta has already ordained and left the palace. \u0100nanda responds to his mother's resistance by moving to Videha () and lives there, taking a vow of silence. This leads him to gain the epithet Videhamuni (), meaning 'the silent wise one from Videha'.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to the P\u0101li tradition, \u0100nanda's first teachers are Bela\u1e6d\u1e6dhas\u012bsa and Pu\u1e47\u1e47a Mant\u0101niputta. It is Pu\u1e47\u1e47a's teaching that leads \u0100nanda to attain the stage of \"sot\u0101panna\" (), an attainment preceding that of enlightenment. \u0100nanda later expresses his debt to Pu\u1e47\u1e47a. Another important figure in the life of \u0100nanda is S\u0101riputta (), one of the Buddha's main disciples. S\u0101riputta often teaches \u0100nanda about the finer points of Buddhist doctrine; they are in the habit of sharing things with one another, and their relationship is described as a good friendship. In some M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts, an attendant of \u0100nanda is also mentioned who helps encourage \u0100nanda when he is banned from the First Buddhist Council. He is a \"Vajjiputta\" (), i.e. someone who originates from the Vajji confederacy. According to later texts, an enlightened monk called Vajjiputta () has an important role in \u0100nanda's life. He listens to a teaching of \u0100nanda and realizes that \u0100nanda is not enlightened yet.

Most importantly, the early texts attribute the inclusion of women in the early \"sa\u1e45gha\" (monastic order) to \u0100nanda. Fifteen years after the Buddha's enlightenment, his foster mother Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b comes to see him to ask him to be ordained as the first Buddhist \"bhikkhun\u012b\". Initially, the Buddha refuses this. Five years later, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b comes to request the Buddha again, this time with a following of other S\u0101kiya women, including the Buddha's former wife Yasodhar\u0101 (). They have walked , look dirty, tired and depressed, and \u0100nanda feels pity for them. \u0100nanda therefore confirms with the Buddha whether women can become enlightened as well. Although the Buddha concedes this, he does not allow the S\u0101kiya women to be ordained yet. \u0100nanda then discusses with the Buddha how Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b took care of him during his childhood, after the death of his real mother. \u0100nanda also mentions that previous Buddhas have also ordained \"bhikkhun\u012bs\".

These are known as the \"garudhamma\", and they describe the subordinate relation of the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" community to that of the \"bhikkhus\" or monks. Asian religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma argues that the debt the Buddha had toward his foster-mother Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati may have been the main reason for his concessions with regard to the establishment of a \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order.", "qas": [{"question": "what did the lay do to the buddha for amendments ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "makes suggestions"}], "id": "(53, 15, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Many scholars interpret this account to mean that the Buddha is reluctant in allowing women to be ordained, and that \u0100nanda successfully persuaded the Buddha to change his mind.

However, some scholars interpret the Buddha's initial refusal rather as a test of resolve, following a widespread pattern in the P\u0101li Canon and in monastic procedure of repeating a request three times before final acceptance. Some also argue that the Buddha was believed by Buddhists to be omniscient, and therefore is unlikely to have been depicted as changing his mind. Other scholars argue that other passages in the texts indicate the Buddha intends all along to establish a \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order. Regardless, during the acceptance of women into the monastic order, the Buddha tells \u0100nanda that the Buddha's dispensation will last shorter because of this reason. At the time, the Buddhist monastic order consisted of wandering celibate males, without many monastic institutions. Allowing women to join the Buddhist celibate life might have led to dissension, as well as temptation between the sexes. The \"garudhamma\", however, are meant to fix these problems, and prevent the dispensation from being curtailed.", "qas": []}, {"context": "There are some chronological discrepancies in the traditional account of the setting up of the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order.

Furthermore, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati is the Buddha's foster mother, and must therefore be considerably older than him. However, after the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order is established, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati still has many audiences with the Buddha, as reported in P\u0101li and Chinese Early Buddhist Texts. Because of this and other reasons, it could be inferred that establishment of the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order actually takes place \"early\" in the Buddha's ministry. If this is the case, \u0100nanda's role in establishing the order becomes less likely. Some scholars therefore interpret the names in the account, such as \"\u0100nanda\" and \"Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati\", as symbols, representing groups rather than specific individuals.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to the texts, \u0100nanda's role in founding the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order makes him popular with the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" community. \u0100nanda often teaches \"bhikkhun\u012bs\", often encourages women to ordain, and when he is criticized by the monk Mah\u0101kassapa, several \"bhikkhun\u012bs\" try to defend him. According to Indologist Oskar von Hin\u00fcber, \u0100nanda's pro-\"bhikkhun\u012b\" attitude may well be the reason why there is frequent discussion between \u0100nanda and Mah\u0101kassapa, eventually leading Mah\u0101kasapa to charge \u0100nanda with several offenses during the First Buddhist Council. Hin\u00fcber further argues that the establishment of the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order may have well been initiated by \u0100nanda after the Buddha's death, and the introduction of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati as the person requesting to do so is merely a literary device to connect the female ordination with the Buddha through his foster mother. Hin\u00fcber concludes this based on several patterns in the early texts, including the apparent distance between the Buddha and the \"bhikkhun\u012b\" order, and the frequent discussions and differences of opinion that take place between \u0100nanda and Mah\u0101kassapa.

Buddhist studies scholar Gregory Schopen has pointed out, however, that this prohibition only holds for \u0100nanda, and only with regard to the Buddha's funeral ceremony.

The P\u0101li commentaries state that after the council, as the tasks for recitation and memorizing the texts are divided, \u0100nanda, and his pupils are given the task to remember the Digha Nik\u0101ya.", "qas": []}, {"context": "During the same council, \u0100nanda is charged for an offense by members of the \"sa\u1e45gha\" for having enabled women to join the monastic order. Besides this, he is charged for having forgotten to request the Buddha to specify which offenses of monastic discipline could be disregarded; for having stepped on the Buddha's robe; for having allowed women to honor the Buddha's body after his death, which was naked, and during which his body was sullied by their tears; and for having failed to ask the Buddha to continue to live on. \u0100nanda does not acknowledge these as offenses, but he concedes to do a formal confession anyway, \"... in faith of the opinion of the venerable elder monks\"\u0100nanda wants to prevent disruption in the \"sa\u1e45gha\". With regard to having women ordained, \u0100nanda answers that he worked hard for that because Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati was the Buddha's foster-mother who had long provided for him. With regard to not requesting the Buddha to continue to live, many textual traditions have \u0100nanda respond by saying he was distracted by M\u0101ra, though one early Chinese text has \u0100nanda reply he did not request the Buddha to prolong his life, for fear that this would interfere with the next Buddha Maitreya's ministry.", "qas": []}, {"context": "According to the P\u0101li tradition, the charges are laid after \u0100nanda has become enlightened and done all the recitations; but the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition has it that the charges are laid before \u0100nanda becomes enlightened and starts the recitations. In this version, when \u0100nanda hears that he is banned from the council, he objects that he has not done anything that goes against the teaching and discipline of the Buddha. Mah\u0101kassapa then lists seven charges to counter \u0100nanda's objection. The charges are similar to the five given in P\u0101li. Other textual traditions list slightly different charges, amounting to a combined total of eleven charges, some of which are only mentioned in one or two textual traditions. Considering that an enlightened disciple was seen to have overcome all faults, it seems more likely that the charges were laid before \u0100nanda's attainment than after.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Indologists von Hin\u00fcber and Jean Przyluski argue that the account of \u0100nanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing early Buddhist schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the discourses (, ) and schools that emphasized monastic discipline. These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition: e.g. the P\u0101li and Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka textual traditions portray a Mah\u0101kassapa that is more critical of \u0100nanda than that the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition depicts them, reflecting a preference for discipline above discourse on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter. Another example is the recitations during the First Council. The P\u0101li texts state that Up\u0101li, the person who is responsible for the recitation of the monastic discipline, recites \u0100nanda does: again, monastic discipline above discourse. Analyzing six textual traditions of the \"Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta\" extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of \u0100nanda, the latter Mah\u0101kassapa. He further argued that the passage on M\u0101ra obstructing the Buddha was inserted in the fourth century BCE, and that \u0100nanda was blamed for M\u0101ra's doing by inserting the passage of \u0100nanda's forgetfulness in the third century BCE. The passage in which the Buddha is ill and reminds \u0100nanda to be his own refuge, on the other hand, Bareau regarded as very ancient, pre-dating the passages blaming M\u0101ra and \u0100nanda. In conclusion, Bareau, Przyluski and Horner argued that the offenses \u0100nanda are charged with are a later interpolation. Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the \"Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta\" and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Tradition states that the First Council lasts for seven months. Scholars doubt, however, whether the entire canon was really recited during the First Council, because the early texts contain different accounts on important subjects such as meditation. It may be, though, that early versions were recited of what is now known as the \"Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka\" and \"Sutta-pi\u1e6daka\". Nevertheless, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as orientalists Louis de La Vall\u00e9e-Poussin and D.P. Minayeff, thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha's death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical. Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist Hermann Oldenberg, considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the Second Council, and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha's death, or any other need to organize the First Council. Much material in the accounts, and even more so in the more developed later accounts, deal with \u0100nanda as the unsullied intermediary who passes on the legitimate teaching of the Buddha. On the other hand, archaeologist Louis Finot, Indologist E. E.

In the texts he is depicted as compassionate in his relations with lay people, a compassion he learnt from the Buddha. The Buddha relays that both monastics and lay people are pleased to see \u0100nanda, and are pleased to hear him recite and teach the Buddha's teaching. Moreover, \u0100nanda is known for his organizational skills, assisting the Buddha with secretary-like duties. In many ways, \u0100nanda does not only serve the personal needs of the Buddha, but also the needs of the still young, growing institute of the \"sa\u1e45gha\".", "qas": [{"question": "who is recognized as one of the most important followers of the buddha ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "\u0100nanda"}], "id": "(53, 32, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Moreover, because of his ability to remember many teachings of the Buddha, he is described as foremost in \"having heard much\" (, , ). \u0100nanda is known for his exceptional memory, which is essential in helping him to remember the Buddha's teachings. He also teaches other disciples to memorize Buddhist doctrine. For these reasons, \u0100nanda is known as the \"Treasurer of the Dhamma\" (, ), \"Dhamma\" () referring to the doctrine of the Buddha. Being the person who has accompanied the Buddha throughout a great part of his life, \u0100nanda is in many ways the living memory of the Buddha, without which the \"sa\u1e45gha\" would be much worse off. Besides his memory skills, \u0100nanda also stands out in that, as the Buddha's cousin, he dares to ask the Buddha direct questions. For example, after the death of Mah\u0101vira and the depicted subsequent conflicts among the Jain community, \u0100nanda asks the Buddha how such problems could be prevented after the Buddha's death. Findly argues that \u0100nanda's duty to memorize the Buddha's teachings accurately and without distortion, is \"both a gift and a burden\". \u0100nanda is able to remember many discourses verbatim, but this also goes hand-in-hand with a habit of not reflecting on those teachings, being afraid that reflection may distort the teachings as he heard them. Thus, judgment of \u0100nanda's character depends much on whether one judges his accomplishments as a monk or his accomplishments as an attendant and person memorizing the discourses. At multiple occasions, \u0100nanda is warned by other disciples that he should spend less time on conversing to lay people, and more time on his own practice. Even though \u0100nanda regularly practices meditation for long hours, he is less experienced in meditative concentration than other leading disciples.", "qas": []}, {"context": "From a literary and pedagogical point of view, \u0100nanda often functions as a kind of foil in the texts, being an unenlightened disciple attending an enlightened Buddha. Because the run-of the-mill person can identify with \u0100nanda, the Buddha can through \u0100nanda convey his teachings to the mass easily. \u0100nanda's character is in many ways a contradiction to that of the Buddha: being unenlightened and someone who makes mistakes. At the same time, however, he is completely devoted to service to the Buddha. The Buddha is depicted in the early texts as both a father and a teacher to \u0100nanda, stern but compassionate. \u0100nanda is very fond of and attached to the Buddha, willing to give his life for him. He mourns the deaths of both S\u0101riputta, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the Buddha: in both cases \u0100nanda is very shocked. \u0100nanda's faith for the Buddha, however, constitutes more of a faith in others, especially the Buddha's person, as opposed to faith in the Buddha's teaching. This is a pattern which comes back in the accounts which lead to the offenses \u0100nanda is charged with during the First Council. Moreover, \u0100nanda's weaknesses are that he is sometimes slow-witted and lacks mindfulness, which becomes noticeable because of his role as attendant to the Buddha: this involves minor matters like deportment, but also more important matters, such as ordaining a man with no future as a pupil, or disturbing the Buddha at the wrong time. For example, one time Mah\u0101kassapa chastises \u0100nanda in strong words, criticizing the fact that \u0100nanda was travelling with a large following of young monks who appeared untrained and who had built up a bad reputation. In another episode described in a Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da text, \u0100nanda is the only disciple who is willing to teach psychic powers to Devadatta, who later uses these in a failed attempt to destroy the Buddha. According to a Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka text, however, when Devadatta turns against the Buddha, \u0100nanda is not persuaded by him, and votes against him in a formal meeting. \u0100nanda's late spiritual growth is much discussed in Buddhist texts, and the general conclusion is that \u0100nanda is slower than other disciples due to his worldly attachments and his attachment to the person of the Buddha, both of which are rooted in his mediating work between the Buddha and the lay communities.", "qas": []}, {"context": "After the Buddha's death, some sources say \u0100nanda stays mostly in the West of India, in the area of Kosamb\u012b (), where he teaches most of his pupils.

According to post-canonical Sanskrit sources such as the Divyavad\u0101na and the A\u015bokavad\u0101na, before the Buddha's death, the Buddha confides to \u0100nanda that his student Majjhantika () will travel to Udy\u0101na, Kashmir, to bring the teaching of the Buddha there.

There is an account dating back from the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da textual traditions which states that before Mah\u0101kassapa dies, he bestows the Buddha's teaching on \u0100nanda as a formal passing on of authority, telling \u0100nanda to pass the teaching on to \u0100nanda's pupil Sa\u1e47av\u0101s\u012b.

On a similar note, in 5th6th-century China and 10th-century Japan, Buddhist texts were composed recommending women to uphold the semi-monastic eight precepts in honor and gratitude of \u0100nanda.

Another tradition that is connected to \u0100nanda is \"paritta\" recitation. Therav\u0101da Buddhists explain that the custom of sprinkling water during \"paritta\" chanting originates in \u0100nanda's visit to Ves\u0101l\u012b, when he recites the \"Ratana Sutta\" and sprinkles water from his alms bowl.

The details of his life are obscure and undocumented because none of his work has been preserved. Anaximenes\u2019s ideas and philosophies are known today because of comments made by Aristotle and other writers on the history of Greek Philosophy. Apollodurus noted the dates Anaximander was alive in relation to defining historical events, and estimated Anaximenes\u2019s lifespan to occur in same time period that Cyrus beat Croesus in the Battle of Thymbra in 546 BCE. Some of his writings survived the Hellenistic Age, but no record of these documents currently exist. As one of the three Milesian philosophers that were considered the first revolutionary thinkers of the Western world, he is best known and identified as a younger friend or student of Anaximander. Much of his astronomical thought was based on Anaximander\u2019s, but he altered Anaximander\u2019s astrological ideas to better fit his own philosophical views on physics and the natural world. The Ionian school was the first school on record that encouraged their pupils to constructively criticize their master\u2019s teachings, which aptly demonstrated a tolerance toward new ideas and logic for their time. Thales taught Anaximander, and Anaximander taught Anaximenes. Each philosopher developed a distinct system of cosmology without completely rejecting their teacher\u2019s view of universe or creating major disagreement between them. Anaximenes, like others in his school of thought, practiced material monism. This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what Anaximenes is principally known for today. Anaximenes was the last known Milesian philosopher, as Miletus was taken over by the Persian army in 494 BC. Because none of his works contain theological references, there is no evidence as to whether or not he practiced religion or if he was an atheist.", "qas": []}, {"context": "While his predecessors Thales and Anaximander proposed that the \"archai\" (singular: \"arche\", meaning the underlying material of the world) were water and the ambiguous substance \"apeiron\", respectively, Anaximenes asserted that \"aer\" (\u201cmist,\u201d \u201cvapor,\u201d \u201cair\u201d) was this primary substance of which all natural things are made. By rejecting his teacher\u2019s theory based on the concept of discontinuity, Anaximenes took a more empirical approach to understanding the underlying processes of genesis and change on two assumptions: (1) origination retains properties of the \"aperion,\" but it has an actually tangible state of existence as air that can evolve other substances and (2) genesis and change depend on a cohesive, mechanistic process known as condensation and rarefaction. He believed that air was infinite and divine. Anaximenes was first to use the word \"Pneuma\" (\u201cbreath of life\u201d) as a synonym with air. One of the only surviving quotes by Anaximenes reads, \u201cJust as our soul...being air holds us together, so \"pneuma\" and air encompass [and guard] the whole world.\u201d The analogy compared atmospheric air as the divine and human air as souls that animate people. This relation of the macroscopic and microscopic suggested Anaximenes believed there was an overarching principle that regulated all life and behavior. Essentially, he thought air was the primary substance that held the Universe together. Interestingly, The Old Testament features a similar analogy to the founding of the world and creation of man, but Anaximenes did not recognize a creator of the universe and did not think the \"pneuma\" as a creator to guide man. The choice of air may seem arbitrary, but Anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of rarefaction and condensation. The primary difference in the forms of air as matter was the degree of condensation and density. When air condenses it becomes visible, and according to Anaximenes, the spread-out, invisible, infinite air was condensed to wind, then formed into clouds, which condensed further to produce mist, rain, and other forms of precipitation. As the condensed air cooled, Anaximenes supposed that Earth itself was an early condensate of air-- the process continued until the air was condensed enough to form solids like the Earth and ultimately stones. By contrast, Anaximenes was able to visually see how water evaporates into air and based his concept of rarefaction on this observation. According to him, any object that held light was made of fire, and fire was made from the rarefaction of air. While other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the qualitative change in hot/dry and cold/wet pairings with the density of a single material, effectively adding a quantitative dimension to the Milesian monistic system. He attributed condensation to cold/wet air and rarefaction to the interaction of hot/dry air. This concept was the foundation for understanding the existence of different substances, materials, and elements due to their arrangement of atoms and number of subatomic particles.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Since language and communication were very limited in his time, Anaximenes\u2019s analogies were key in explaining the uncertain through the certain. For example, he knew for certain that blowing air on his hand with his mouth wide open produced hot air, while blowing on his hand with half-closed lips produced cold air. These observations were key in his postulate that the hot air was due to rarefaction and expansion, whereas the cold air was due to condensation and compression. Although in modern times it is known that this is actually the opposite, Anaximenes was key in arriving at this conclusion. His analogies often connected parallels between man and the cosmos, insinuating that the same natural laws observable on earth applied to the heavens. Over 2000 years later, Isaac Newton proved this to be true. Throughout history, Anaximenes\u2019s observations proved helpful to uncover powerful theories, such as quantum physics and chemical properties. By the end of the Milesian philosophy era, there were many questions left unanswered; this sparked the stimulation of Pre-socratic thought to continue through many other notable philosophers such as Pythagoras, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Democritus.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Anaximenes greatest influence is not from his theories of matter, but instead it is from how he thought about these ideas. For instance, his theory of air being the underlying substance was disproved, but when looking at his idea from a fundamental aspect, in which a substance is capable of changing forms, his theory was the first of its kind. This concept of changing of forms is fundamental to scientific thought and shows how his ideas, although not correct, were helpful in the development of modern views. In the time of Anaximenes, phenomena were usually explained with reference to religion and mythology. Anaximenes explained events like rainbows with concrete ideas instead of saying they were the work of a goddess. The explanation Anaximenes gave helped in the transition of attributing the cause of phenomena to scientific events, rather than mythology.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Many similarities to Anaximenes\u2019s theories are apparent in Plato\u2019s theory. So much so, that some scholars have said Plato has based his theory of matter on Anaximenes\u2019s theory. In Aristotle\u2019s view on Anaximenes, he interprets the theory as the one substance being air, and all other states of matter are different condensations of air. In Plato\u2019s interpretation of Anaximenes\u2019s theory, he considers the seven states of matter: fire, air, wind, clouds, earth and stone as different densities. Acknowledging that these seven states of matter are different densities shows how the intrinsic properties of the matter have changed, and they are actually different substances. Anaximenes supports this conclusion by his explanation using the concept of felting. Felting is a technological model used to explain condensation, in which wool turns into felt and has new properties. Just as how wind is compressed into clouds in Anaximenes\u2019s theory. Without recognizing Anaximenes\u2019s influence on Plato, and simply focusing on Anaximenes\u2019s influence on Aristotle, Anaximenes\u2019s contributions to scientific thought are not fully recognized. Aristotle interpreted Anaximenes\u2019s theory as all substance being different manifestations of air. It was Plato\u2019s interpretation of Anaximenes\u2019s theory that recognized the fundamental changes of air into other substances.

Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air. Anaximenes did not think that stars were floating leaf-like bodies similar to the earth and sun; instead, he thought of stars being similar to nails that are stuck in a transparent shell. In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars. While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars, but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion. Similarly, he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air. In his theory, when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth, but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant. Anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head. Anaximenes believed that the sky was a dome, and day and night are caused by celestial bodies being carried North until they are no longer seen.

In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks, so that hills collapse and cause earthquakes. Lightning is similarly caused by the violent separation of clouds by the wind, creating a bright, fire-like flash. Rainbows, on the other hand, are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun. These examples show how Anaximenes, like the other Milesian philosophers, looked for the broader picture in nature.

They then settled in for the three-day trip to Fra Mauro.\nApproaching 56 hours into the mission, Apollo 13 was approximately from Earth en route to the Moon. Approximately six and a half minutes after the end of a live TV broadcast from the spacecraft, Haise was in the process of closing out the LM, while Lovell was stowing the TV camera. Houston flight controllers asked Swigert to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans in the service module, which were designed to destratify the cryogenic contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings. Two minutes later, the astronauts heard a \"pretty large bang\", accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and the firing of the attitude control thrusters; the crew initially thought that a meteoroid might have struck the lunar module. Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8 seconds, until the system automatically corrected by switching the high-gain S-band antenna, used for translunar communications, from narrow-beam to wide-beam mode.\nImmediately after the bang, Swigert reported a \"problem\", which Lovell repeated and clarified as a \"main B bus undervolt\", a temporary loss of operating voltage on the second of the spacecraft's main electrical circuits. Oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero. About three minutes later, the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed. Lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting \"a gas of some sort\" into space.

The crew was forced to shut down the CM completely to save this for reentry, and to power up the LM to use as a \"lifeboat\". This situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation, but had not been considered a likely scenario. Without the LM, the accident would certainly have been fatal.\nThe damage to the service module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz ordered an abort of the mission. The existing abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the service propulsion system (SPS) engine to achieve a delta-\"v\". Although a successful SPS firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time (GET) would land the crew one day earlier (at 118 hours GET, or 58 hours later), the large delta-\"v\" was possible only if the LM were jettisoned first, and since crew survival depended on the LM's presence during the coast back to Earth, that option was \"out of the question.\" An alternative would have been to burn the SPS fuel to depletion, then jettison the service module and make a second burn with the LM Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine. It was desired to keep the service module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the command module's heat shield. Apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar sphere of gravitational influence (at 61 hours GET), which was the break-even point between direct and circumlunar aborts, and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn. There also was concern about \"the structural integrity of the Service Module,\" so mission planners were instructed that the SPS engine would not be used \"except as a last-ditch effort.\"", "qas": []}, {"context": "For these reasons, Kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option, using the Moon's gravity to return the ship to Earth. Apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission, as required for the lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the DPS. The descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon (\"PC+2 burn\"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the service module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort, but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used. The 4-minute, 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew, flight controllers, and support personnel for the safe return.

Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface EVA. Unlike the command and service module (CSM), which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, the LM was powered by silver-zinc batteries, so electrical power and water (used for equipment cooling as well as drinking) were critical consumables. To keep the LM life-support and communication systems operational until reentry, the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible. In particular, the LM's Abort Guidance System was used for most of the coast back to Earth instead of the primary guidance system, as it used less power and water.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Availability of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) for removing carbon dioxide presented a serious problem. The LM's internal stock of LiOH canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return, and the remainder was stored in the descent stage, out of reach. The CM had an adequate supply of canisters, but these were incompatible with the LM. Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose. NASA engineers referred to the improvised device as \"the mailbox\".", "qas": []}, {"context": "Another problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down command module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Flight controller John Aaron, with the support of grounded astronaut Mattingly and many engineers and designers, had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ship's limited power supply and time factor. This was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the LM caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as . The unpowered CM got so cold that water began to condense on solid surfaces, causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated. This turned out not to be a problem, partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the Apollo 1 fire.", "qas": []}, {"context": "The last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before reentry. The normal procedure was to use the service module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the command module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed to solve the problem within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the lunar module to the command module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to reentry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.", "qas": []}, {"context": "As Apollo 13 neared Earth, the crew first jettisoned the service module, using the LM's reaction control system to pull themselves a safe distance from it, instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the SM's RCS.

Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less-than-ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew motion sickness, which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew were unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe head cold. As a result, he became irritable with requests from Mission Control and all three astronauts began \"talking back\" to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:\nSCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.\nCAPCOM (Jack Swigert): Roger.

No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.\nSCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.\nA further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous Project Mercury and Gemini experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to pinch their noses and blow to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous \"fishbowl\" type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:", "qas": []}, {"context": "CAPCOM 1 (Deke Slayton): Okay.

I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. \nSCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. \nCAPCOM 1: Yes. \nSCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. \nCAPCOM 1: Understand that.

In 1939, coinciding with the start of World War II, Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, tyrothricin, a compound of 20% gramicidin and 80% tyrocidine, from \"B. brevis.\" It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II. Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage.

Targets include:\nMetabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic-tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Vaccines rely on immune modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of macrophages, the production of antibodies, inflammation, and other classic immune reactions.

Phage therapy infects pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses. Bacteriophages and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus they do not disturb the host organism and intestinal microflora unlike antibiotics. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, infect and can kill bacteria and affect bacterial growth primarily during lytic cycles. Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain. The high specificity of phage protects \"good\" bacteria from destruction. However, some disadvantages to use of bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and identification of genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing may be prudent prior to use. In addition, the oral and IV administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application, and there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails. There are considerable regulatory hurdles that must be cleared for such therapies. The use of bacteriophages as a replacement for antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens no longer respond to conventional antibiotics remains an attractive option despite numerous challenges.", "qas": [{"question": "what is phage therapy a method for ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria"}], "id": "(83, 50, 0)"}]}, {"context": "Plants are an important source of antimicrobial compounds and traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious diseases.

Phytochemicals are the active biological component of plants and some phytochemicals including tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids possess antimicrobial activity. Some antioxidant dietary supplements also contain phytochemicals (polyphenols), such as grape seed extract, and demonstrate \"in vitro\" anti-bacterial properties.
