several other conditions are common in children with autism
how autism occurs is not well understood
the terminology of autism can be bewildering ,  with autism ,  asperger syndrome and pdd-nos often called the `` autism spectrum disorders ''  -lrb-  asd  -rrb-  or sometimes the `` autistic disorders '' ,  whereas autism itself is often called `` autistic disorder '' ,  `` childhood autism '' ,  or `` infantile autism ''
these organizations include autism speaks ,  autism national committee ,  autism society of america ,  and many others
there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism . 
it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism
in 1987, the dsm-iii-r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism
the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism
social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders  -lrb-  asd; see classification  -rrb-  from other developmental disorders
there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life
most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism
it took until 1980 for the dsm-iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia
donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism
however ,  most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified

achilles' most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan hero hector outside the gates of troy
in this island there is also achilles' temple and his statue ''
in greek mythology ,  achilles or achilleus  -lrb-   ;  ,  `` achilleus ''   -rrb-  was a greek hero of the trojan war and the central character and the greatest warrior of homer's `` iliad ''
when the greeks left for the trojan war ,  they accidentally stopped in mysia ,  ruled by king telephus
homer's `` iliad '' is the most famous narrative of achilles' deeds in the trojan war
achilles chose the former ,  and decided to take part in the trojan war
achilles' cult was also to be found at other places ,  e
the trojans ,  led by hector ,  subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships
although the death of achilles is not presented in the `` iliad '' ,  other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris ,  who shot him in the heel with an arrow

republicans linked lincoln's name to their party
then lincoln began his practice with william herndon ,  whom lincoln thought `` a studious young man '' . 
while the war was still being waged ,  lincoln faced reelection in 1864
captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 1786
lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions
lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846
tall for his age ,  lincoln was also strong and athletic
as lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew ,  so did his supporters

lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs
for aristotle ,  the soul is the form of a living being
the forms also differ in their object of imitation
347 bc  -rrb- 
plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things
humans have a rational soul
during sleep ,  a person is in an altered state of mind
so ,  according to aristotle ,  the form of apple exists within each apple ,  rather than in the world of the forms . 
the books are:
plato argued that all things have a universal form ,  which could be either a property or a relation to other things
with this definition of the particular substance  -lrb-  i . e .  ,  matter and form  -rrb-  ,  aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings ,  for example ,  `` what is it that makes a man one '' ?  since ,  according to plato there are two ideas: animal and biped ,  how then is man a unity ?  however ,  according to aristotle ,  the potential being  -lrb-  matter  -rrb-  and the actual one  -lrb-  form  -rrb-  are one and the same . 
aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations
when we look at an apple ,  for example ,  we see an apple ,  and we can also analyse a form of an apple
for example ,  it is possible that there is no particular good in existence ,  but `` good '' is still a proper universal form
aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically ,  and biology forms a large part of his writings
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory `` stricto sensu '': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning
with the `` prior analytics '' ,  aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic ,  and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic
in this distinction ,  there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple
where plato spoke of the world of forms ,  a place where all universal forms subsist ,  aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated
most of aristotle's work is probably not in its original form ,  because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers
because all beings are composites of form and matter ,  the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings ,  e . g

the term `` pathological altruism '' was popularised by the book `` pathological altruism '' . 
this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god
altruism is essential to the sikh religion
altruism figures prominently in buddhism
this is defined as bestowal ,  or giving ,  which is the intention of altruism
altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism ,  but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless
the word `` altruism '' was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french ,  as `` altruisme '' ,  for an antonym of egoism
judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation
he identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self  -lrb-  egoism  -rrb-  ,  to ultimately benefit the other person  -lrb-  altruism  -rrb-  ,  to benefit a group  -lrb-  collectivism  -rrb-  ,  or to uphold a moral principle  -lrb-  principlism  -rrb-

 ''kinship '' can refer both to `` the study of '' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures ,  or it can refer to `` the patterns of social relationships '' themselves
anthropology is the study of humans and human behavior and societies in the past and present
anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities ,  social sciences and natural sciences
there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences
the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology ,  as kinship is a human universal
anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences ,  including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of `` homo sapiens '' ,  human physical traits ,  human behavior ,  the variations among different groups of humans ,  how the evolutionary past of `` homo sapiens '' has influenced its social organization and culture ,  and from social sciences ,  including the organization of human social and cultural relations ,  institutions ,  social conflicts ,  etc
archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains
biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals  -lrb-  behaviors ,  ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures  -rrb- 
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology
linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life
evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science ,  combining the human development with socioeconomic factors
anthropologists ,  along with other social scientists ,  are working with the us military as part of the us army's strategy in afghanistan
other types include cyber anthropology ,  a relatively new area of internet research ,  as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media ,  such as development work ,  social movements ,  or health education
the sub-field is also defined as ,  `` the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment ''
it focuses on the following six basic fields:
the three terms are often confused
through the 14th and 15th centuries ,  alchemists were much like flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone
st augustine later affirmed this in the 4th & 5th centuries ,  but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry
through much of the 12th and 13th centuries ,  alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations ,  and new latin contributions were not made
this move was mostly successful ,  and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries ,  and even to the present day . 
in the late 15th century ,  marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin
they wrote in greek and lived in egypt under roman rule . 
this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries ,  based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton . 
buddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold
it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world ,  facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries . 
nityanātha siddha wrote `` rasaratnākara '' ,  also a highly influential work
gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 1241, and in europe by the 14th century . 
music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers
although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century ,  alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years ,  and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century
during the occult revival of the early 19th century ,  alchemy received new attention as an occult science
described in 9th-century texts and used in fireworks in china by the 10th century ,  it was used in cannons by 1290
in the early 12th century ,  peter abelard followed anselm's work ,  laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west
alien -lrb-  s  -rrb-  ,  or the alien -lrb-  s  -rrb-  may also refer to:
they spend the majority of their time working on research ,  although they quite often have other duties such as teaching ,  building instruments ,  or aiding in the operation of an observatory . 
while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers ,  the field is popular among amateurs
revisions of the ascii standard:
ascii was developed from telegraph code
furthermore ,  the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii . 
because of his extensive work on ascii ,  bemer has been called `` the father of ascii '' . 
ascii is one of the ieee milestones . 
the main deviations in ascii order are:
iso/iec 646, like ascii ,  is a 7-bit character set
ascii was incorporated into the unicode  -lrb-  1991 -rrb- character set as the first 128 symbols ,  so the 7-bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets
2  -lrb-  ita2 -rrb- standard of 1924, fieldata  -lrb-  1956 -rrb- ,  and early ebcdic  -lrb-  1963 -rrb- ,  more than 64 codes were required for ascii . 
this allows utf-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ascii ,  as a utf-8 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters

since 2009, the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film . 
the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase ,  the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films
when film became a common medium some manufacturers of optical toys adapted small magic lanterns into toy film projectors for short loops of film
several other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: africa movie academy award for best animation  -lrb-  since 2008 -rrb- ,  bafta award for best animated film  -lrb-  since 2006 -rrb- ,  césar award for best animated film  -lrb-  since 2011 -rrb- ,  golden rooster award for best animation  -lrb-  since 1981 -rrb- ,  goya award for best animated film  -lrb-  since 1989 -rrb- ,  japan academy prize for animation of the year  -lrb-  since 2007 -rrb- ,  national film award for best animated film  -lrb-  since 2006 -rrb-
disney/pixar have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award
animated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins  -lrb-  around 52%  -rrb-  of all film genres in the 2004–2013 timeframe . 
unlike live-action films ,  animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film
also since 2007, the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards

apollo brought him up and educated him
apollo wished to court her
ileus was very dear to apollo . 
apollo was declared the winner because of this .

asclepius is the most famous son of apollo
the lyre is a common attribute of apollo
then apollo struck the strings of his lyre
in cult practice ,  delian apollo and pythian apollo  -lrb-  the apollo of delphi  -rrb-  were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality
castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved
apollo's music is soulful and enchanting
other male lovers of apollo include:
once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo ,  the god of music
the family-festival was dedicated to apollo  -lrb-  doric:   -rrb- 
apollo raised and educated the child on his own . 
oracles were also given by sons of apollo . 
his skills as a physician surpassed that of apollo's
the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning
apollo promises to protect orestes ,  as orestes has become apollo's supplicant
the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks
captivated by the god's beauty ,  he kissed apollo
apollo advocates orestes at the trial ,  and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo . 
at delphi ,  apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho
she bore to apollo a son ,  whom apollo named ileus ,  after the city of his birth ,  ilion  -lrb-  troy  -rrb- 
apollo as a handsome beardless young man ,  is often depicted with a kithara  -lrb-  as apollo citharoedus  -rrb-  or bow in his hand ,  or reclining on a tree  -lrb-  the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types  -rrb- 
apollo was the immortal god of `` ideal balance and order ''
this island later became sacred to apollo . 
apollo defended his mother and killed python
apollo is often associated with the golden mean
apollo's most common attributes were the bow and arrow
hence ,  apollo then became a master of the lyre .
