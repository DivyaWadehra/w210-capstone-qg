Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote: \"A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation\". Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics as well as their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics. Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote: \"The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and\u00a0[...] the first anarchist society was that of the apostles\". In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.\nThe French Renaissance political philosopher \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie wrote in his most famous work the \"Discourse on Voluntary Servitude\" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term \"anarchist\" first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents. By the time of the French Revolution, some such as the Enraged Ones began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing \"revolutionary government\" as oxymoronic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word \"anarchism\" had lost its initial negative connotation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what theory is the founder of modern anarchist theory ?\n", "id": "(0, 9, 1)", "answers": []}], "context": "The French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work \"What is Property?\", published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is \"Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order\". In \"What is Property?\", Proudhon answers with the famous accusation \"Property is theft\". In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed \"property\" (\"propri\u00e9t\u00e9\"), where owners have complete rights to \"use and abuse\" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called \"possession\", or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. However, Proudhon later added that \"Property is Liberty\" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what type of programme does imier congress adopt ?\n", "id": "(0, 12, 6)", "answers": []}], "context": "Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: \"The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London.

Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers\". In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.

They included Louise Michel, the Reclus brothers (\u00c9lie Reclus and \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus) and Eugene Varlin (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the \"implementation of the binding mandate\" in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states that \"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elis\u00e9e Reclus and Louise Michel\"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the main principle behind the anarchist federations ?\n", "id": "(0, 25, 5)", "answers": []}], "context": "In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.

Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.

Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.\nLincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had \"invaded \"our territory\" and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our \"own soil\"\".

As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.

Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored. However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience. During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.

Aristotle states that \"mimesis\" is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\". Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\" For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average.

Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors. However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self. Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (principlism). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless. The \"empathy-altruism hypothesis\" basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering. Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.\nIn psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the \"Bystander effect\"). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the translation of the international atomic time ?\n", "id": "(13, 28, 0)", "answers": []}], "context": "The term \"pathological altruism\" was popularised by the book \"Pathological Altruism\"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what religion is essential to the hindu religion ?\n", "id": "(13, 31, 0)", "answers": []}], "context": "Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism.

This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of \"Apollo\". The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the Egyptian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods. The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in \"ideal forms\" that can be imagined and represented. These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of \"ideal balance and order\". His shrine in Delphi, that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: (gn\u014dthi seaut\u00f3n=\"know thyself\") and (\"m\u0113d\u00e9n \u00e1gan\", \"nothing in excess\"), and (egg\u00fda p\u00e1ra d'at\u0113, \"make a pledge and mischief is nigh\").\nIn the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640\u2013580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself. A fine example is the statue of the \"Sacred Gate Kouros\" which was found at the cemetery of Dipylon in Athens (Dipylon Kouros). The statue is the \"thing in itself\", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the Dipylon master was named Daedalus, and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the \"New York kouros\", which is the oldest fully preserved statue of \"Kouros\" type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.\nThe animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the Homeric poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god Hephaestus (Phaistos) and the mythic Daedalus (the builder of the labyrinth) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the Minoan period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.
