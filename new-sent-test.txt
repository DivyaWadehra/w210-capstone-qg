7 for autism and as high as 0.
 Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.
 The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism".

Autism

Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.


Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders.
 There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism.
 Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism.

Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
 It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism.
 Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.
 There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life.


The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism.
 These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

 Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.
 If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C.


Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices.
 Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow.
 For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.

 Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies.


Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology.
Anthropology

Anthropology is the study of humans and human behavior and societies in the past and present.
 Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies.
 More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community.
 Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.
 Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.
 In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.
 Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.
 Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.
 These include techno-anthropology, digital ethnography, cyberanthropology, and virtual anthropology.


Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently.
 It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.
 Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life.


In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe.
