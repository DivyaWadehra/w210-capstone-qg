Two types of Gold Standard are produced this year:

- USED in the EVALUATION: for each language, reading tests are ordered in different ways. This file reproduces the order in which reading tests are given in the test set.

- PARALLEL ALIGNED: all reading tests are given in the same order in all languages.

Even though questions and multiple-choice answers are the same in all languages, some reading tests have been ordered differently to avoid perfect correspondence of data in different languages, thus making the task more challanging, as in this way the results obtained in one dataset are not directly transferable to the others.
