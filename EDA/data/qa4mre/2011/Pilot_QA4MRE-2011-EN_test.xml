The 2008 Nobel science prizesAll colours of the brainbowPrizes for research on HIV, cancer, symmetry and fluorescent proteinOct 9th 2008 | From The Economist print editionSometimes the absence of something can be as telling as its presence. So it is with this year’s Nobel prize for medicine. Two of the winners were Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, who got it for the discovery of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But the third (and convention dictates that the prize is split a maximum of three ways) was Harald zur Hausen. He was awarded it for a completely different study, the one which showed that human papilloma viruses cause cervical cancer.Dividing the prize between two studies is not unusual. In this case, though, it was rather pointed. What the committee did not do was name a third HIV researcher, Robert Gallo, to share the glory and the SKr10m ($1.4m). And that omission undoes what many regard as an injustice—a cobbled-together diplomatic agreement between America and France, made in 1987, to let Dr Gallo (an American) share the credit for the discovery with Dr Montagnier (a Frenchman). A lot of workers in the field think true credit belongs overwhelmingly to Dr Montagnier and his team, which included Dr Barré-Sinoussi, whose name headed the paper that originally fingered HIV in 1983.The details of the dispute are arcane, and no one doubts that both groups did important research on HIV. Though Dr Barré-Sinoussi and Dr Montagnier, working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, suspected their new virus (which they called LAV) was the cause of AIDS, it was Dr Gallo, working at America’s National Cancer Institute, who provided the proof a year later. But the nub of the matter is the suggestion that the virus identified by Dr Gallo (and which he called HTLV-III) was not any old HIV, but one that had come, by means that remain obscure, but probably as the result of accidental contamination of another sample, from Dr Montagnier’s laboratory. Dr Gallo had initially suggested that AIDS was caused by HTLV-I, a virus that no one disputes he discovered.Dr zur Hausen’s work is mired in no such controversy. Working in the Universities of Erlangen-Nuremberg and Freiburg in the 1970s and 1980s, he first hypothesised that papilloma viruses, which cause skin warts, are also the cause of cervical tumours, and then gathered evidence to prove the point. By the 1990s, the connection was well established, and work began on vaccines. These are now available for general use. At least 90% of cervical cancer is known to be caused by papilloma viruses, and Dr zur Hausen suspects that all are. Widespread vaccination could thus make cervical cancer a thing of the past.The physics prize was similarly divided between three people and two studies. Yoichiro Nambu, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa all worked on what is known as symmetry breaking. The very existence of the universe is one example of this. If matter and antimatter were truly symmetrical, then they would have come into existence in equal amounts during the Big Bang and thus annihilated each other. The fact that some matter was left over shows they are not, in fact, symmetrical. Dr Nambu, who was at the University of Chicago, provided the mathematical foundations for understanding the spontaneous breaking of symmetries in fundamental physics. Dr Kobayashi and Dr Maskawa, who were at Japan’s High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation and Kyoto University respectively, described a type of symmetry breaking that predicted two new families of quarks, a sort of subatomic particle whose simplest members are the ingredients of the protons and neutrons that form atomic nuclei.The chemistry prize went, as is often the case these days, to a discovery that is as much biological as chemical. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien were responsible for the discovery of a substance called green fluorescent protein, and its development into an important tool of modern biology. GFP, as it is known to its friends, gives the glow to Aequorea victoria, a jellyfish that lives in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Dr Shimomura, who worked at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, isolated this protein in 1962. Dr Chalfie and Dr Tsien, of Columbia University and the University of California, San Diego, respectively, made it useful.Dr Chalfie realised that if the GFP gene could be spliced into a chromosome next to the gene for a protein of interest, it would be controlled by the same genetic switch as that protein. Thus, when the protein of interest was made, GFP would be made, too. He tested his idea in a tiny nematode worm called Caenorhabditis elegans and, in 1994, published a paper showing how touch-receptor proteins are distributed around this worm. Since then, the technique has become ubiquitous.Dr Tsien’s contribution was to tinker with the GFP gene, and the genes of related proteins found in corals, to produce other colours. The result is that biologists can study the expression of many different genes at the same time, a technique spectacularly illustrated last year by a group of researchers at Harvard who produced what they called brainbows. By selecting fluorescent proteins in three primary colours they made pictures of parts of mouse brains in which the individual nerve cells glow in all colours of the rainbow, depending on the mixture of proteins within. The search is now on for the pot of intellectual gold at the end of it all.

AIDSDARC continentA tiny genetic change may help explain why AIDS is so common in AfricaJul 17th 2008 | From The Economist print editionWhy is AIDS so much more prevalent in Africa than in other parts of the world? The question is both important and controversial. It is important because two-thirds of those infected with HIV, the virus that causes the disease, live on that continent. It is controversial because some of the explanations are behavioural, and are seen by many as racist slurs.Broadly, there are three proposed explanations. One is that because AIDS started in Africa, it has had more time to spread there. The second—the behavioural one—is that both formal and informal polygamy are more common in Africa than elsewhere. The third is that African physiology is unusually susceptible to the disease.All three probably play a part. But a paper just published in Cell Host &amp; Microbe suggests that a significant part of the answer may indeed be physiological. Weijing He of the University of Texas Health Science Centre, in San Antonio, and his colleagues have discovered that a genetic variation which is common in Africa both makes people more susceptible to infection and keeps them in a symptom-free state for longer, allowing them to pass the disease on.Surface tensionThis variation involves the flipping of a single genetic “letter” in a gene called DARC (the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines). This gene, as its name suggests, encodes a protein that regulates the level in the bloodstream of inflammation-causing chemicals called chemokines. That protein sits, among other places, on the surfaces of red blood cells. Or, rather, in the variant, it doesn’t. The mutation means that Duffy receptor proteins are not made in red cells.Since other chemokine receptors are known to be involved in AIDS, and since two-thirds of sub-Saharan Africans lack the Duffy receptor on their red blood cells although such a lack is rare in other groups of people, it seemed an obvious candidate for investigation. Unfortunately, the team did not have a suitable group of Africans available for study. They did, however, have access to a group of American airmen, some of whom are of African descent. America is good at looking after its servicemen’s health and, in exchange, many of those airmen have agreed to be part of a long-term medical study that looks at all sorts of health-related questions. Indeed, some have participated in this study for 22 years.Dr He and his colleagues looked at the genes of airmen who classified themselves as black and found that the ones infected with HIV were more likely to lack red cells bearing the Duffy receptor than chance would suggest. Moreover, and more unexpectedly, such people took two years longer to progress from the point where they were infected with the virus to the one where they began to show the first symptoms of AIDS. That is two years when a man ignorant of his infection would be less likely to take precautions to stop it spreading. The upshot, when the team crunched the numbers, was that the variant form of DARC may be responsible for 11% of the African epidemic.The mystery is why the variant of DARC that leaves red blood cells without receptors should be so harmful. The team also did some laboratory experiments, which showed that HIV binds to the receptor. Although that mops up HIV from the bloodstream, the virus then passes from the red blood cells to the white immune-system cells most susceptible to infection. An absence of receptors should therefore be a good thing, because it closes off a shortcut to infection. Clearly it is not, nor do the team know why their absence prolongs the period that the disease is latent.That is an important lesson about the difficulty of extrapolating laboratory results into the real world. Had the two arms of the study not been carried out in parallel, future researchers might have travelled up an expensive and time-consuming blind alley.Another question is why such a disastrous mutation should have spread so widely in Africa. The answer is probably that it once protected against another disease, malaria. Indeed, it still does, to a certain extent. The variant form of DARC stops the growth of Plasmodium vivax, one of the four parasites that can cause malaria. This parasite is not, however, as deadly as Plasmodium falciparum, the main cause of malarial mortality. Nor is it as widespread in Africa. But it is not just people who evolve to evade pathogens. Pathogens evolve to evade the evasions. And that is what Robin Weiss of University College, London, another member of the team, suspects has happened. He reckons falciparum was once controlled by variant DARC. But no longer. It has managed to escape that control, and left humanity with a genetic weakness that another pathogen, HIV, has exploited.

Science &amp; TechnologyAIDS vaccinesDouble, not quitsA big AIDS-vaccine trial reports encouraging resultsSep 24th 2009 | From The Economist onlineShutterstockSome good news about AIDS. After more than two decades of research those labouring to find a vaccine against HIV, the virus that causes the disease, have found a method that might actually work.This method, known as “prime-boost”, has been tested on more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand. The volunteers were drawn from the general public, rather than specifically from groups at particular risk such as gay men, recreational-drug injectors or prostitutes. The preliminary results of the trial, which was called RV144 and was organised by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, were announced on Thursday September 24th.The upshot is that the technique on trial seems to reduce the risk of an uninfected individual contacting the virus by about 31%. That is below the 50% reduction rate defined as showing “unequivocal clinical benefit”, and the margin of error is wide, so it does not suggest that the experimental vaccine should now be deployed for general use. It is, however, enough to justify putting effort into improving this approach.Traditional vaccines work mainly by priming the immune system so that it knows how to make antibodies to a particular infectious agent. Antibodies are proteins that stick onto a pathogen and gum up its works. The active principle of the vaccine, known as an antigen, is the bit of the pathogen that the immune system recognises and that the antibody sticks on. Prime-boost techniques, which are also being developed to attack malaria, work mainly by stimulating another part of the immune system—one that kills infected body cells rather than “naked” pathogens. This cell-killing system, too, recognises antigens, but it finds them on the surface of an infected cell.The experimental evidence suggests that a particularly good way of activating the cell-killing arm of the immune system is to use two vaccines based on different antigens. One primes the response and the other boosts it—hence the technique’s name. In the case of RV144 the boosting vaccine, AIDSVAX, had been the subject of a previous trial in Thailand, and also of one in North America and Europe. Those two trials, intended to raise a traditional antibody-based response, were regarded at the time as the best hope for an effective vaccine. They were a bitter disappointment. When they reported in 2003 they showed no benefit whatsoever. They did, however, show that AIDSVAX was safe, and although it was abandoned by its commercial backers at the time, it was picked up by a Californian charity called Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases.The antigen in AIDSVAX is a genetically engineered version of gp120, a protein that HIV uses to lock onto the cells it subsequently infects. By contrast the priming vaccine, called ALVAC and made by Sanofi Pasteur, a French firm, contains synthetic versions of three HIV genes. It, too, had been tested for safety in previous trials, but none of those trials were designed to see if it was also efficacious. Unlike AIDSVAX, ALVAC is made of highly engineered viruses into which the antigenic genes have been incorporated. These viruses are versions of canarypox, which is nothing like HIV (so there is no risk of someone contracting AIDS from them) and, in any case, they have been tinkered with so that they cannot reproduce. A full course of the RV144 regime lasted six months and consisted of four shots of ALVAC and two of AIDSVAX.One criticism of RV144 is that the versions of the antigens it used came from subtypes B and E of HIV. These are the most common forms in, respectively, North America and Europe, and in South-East Asia (including Thailand). Given where the trial was carried out, that makes sense. But the place crying out for a vaccine is sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of the world’s HIV-infected people live, and two-thirds of new infections are happening. This continent, the place where HIV originated, has the greatest variety of subtypes. Subtypes B and E, though, are not common there.There is also some doubt about how much actual boosting is going on. AIDSVAX, after all, failed the first time round and since ALVAC has, until now, been tested only for safety and not for efficacy, how well it would work by itself (and thus how much contribution the AIDSVAX is making) remains unknown.But these are minor quibbles about what was intended as an experimental proof of principle. The RV144 trial suggests that an AIDS vaccine can indeed work in principle. Now it is time to get down to the nitty-gritty of making it work in practice.

The XVIIth International AIDS ConferenceWin some, lose someThe battle against AIDS is becoming a war of attrition. Which side is on top is not yet clearIllustration by Ian WhadcockAug 7th 2008 | MEXICO CITY | From The Economist print editionIf money is the sinews of war, as Cicero suggested, then it is always good to have America on your side. America bankrolled the second world war, and it looks as though it is going to bankroll the war on AIDS, too. On July 30th George Bush signed an act reauthorising PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It provides for $39 billion to be spent on AIDS over the next five years, up from $15 billion for the past five. It was a welcome backdrop to the XVIIth International AIDS Conference, held this week in Mexico. Mr Bush has been on the receiving end of a lot of flak from AIDS activists for imposing conditions on the way PEPFAR’s budget is disbursed—preferring chastity to condoms, for example—but, overall, he has been a force for good in the field of AIDS. PEPFAR was his own idea and, as the old saying has it, he who pays the piper calls the tune. In that context $39 billion is a positive symphony.There is also good news elsewhere. The latest report from UNAIDS, the United Nations agency charged with combating the disease, was released on July 29th. It suggests that the death rate from AIDS is now falling. It peaked in 2005 at 2.2m a year. Now it is down to 2m, thanks to the torrent of money that is providing patients in poorer parts of the world with drugs that keep HIV, the virus that causes the disease, under control (see chart). Of course there are critics, too. The aim was to provide such drugs to all who need them by 2010. This was always going to be a tall order. The target has not been formally abandoned. But Stephen Lewis, a former UN special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, says that a close reading of the report suggests its authors no longer believe in the deadline. Mr Lewis reckons the activists are being softened up for a slippage to 2015.That would be a disappointment. And there have been several of those since the last conference, two years ago in Toronto. Then the talk was of new forms of prevention—in particular, of vaginal microbicides that would stop women getting infected; of the suppression of genital herpes, which is thought to help HIV get into the body; and even of pressing the good old contraceptive diaphragm into use to block the virus. But three trials of microbicides have now failed, and so have two herpes-suppression trials and one trial of diaphragms. As for vaccines, the shimmering hope on the horizon of every AIDS conference, the one big trial to report has more than just failed; for many of the participants the vaccine seemed to make things worse. The consensus among vaccine researchers now seems to be that future trials should be abandoned and the money saved spent on basic science.On top of all this gloom, it is still the case that nobody has the faintest clue how to cure someone once they have been infected with HIV. The drugs, welcome as they are, merely stave off the immune-system crash that opens the victim to lethal secondary infections such as tuberculosis. That means you have to stay on them for life. As a result, taxpayers are accumulating an indefinite—and indefinitely growing—responsibility for keeping people alive. Somehow, somebody has to work out how to stop the disease spreading.The pill or the snip?Oddly, one possible way of making a big dent in the problem has been sitting under people’s noses for years. Anti-retrovirals, or ARVs, as the drugs used to treat AIDS are known, work by stopping HIV from breeding. They do not cure, because there are places in the body that the virus can hide from them. But while someone is taking the drugs, the virus almost disappears from his blood stream—and, crucially, his seminal fluid. Moreover, if the infected individual is a she, rather than a he, the drugs have a tendency to accumulate in the tissue of the vagina.Those observations are leading in three directions. The first is the idea of pre-exposure prophylaxis—in other words, giving ARVs to uninfected people to clobber any new infection before it can get going. Two trials of this approach will report next year.The second is to use ARVs as microbicides. The unsuccessful microbicide trials used either long, complicated molecules intended to act as a physical barrier to the viruses or detergents to disrupt them. ARVs in the vagina might stop them breeding before they get into the body.The third approach, though, is the most intriguing. This is to do nothing more than press ahead faster with the treatment programme. Since treatment reduces viral load, it should, in theory, make those being treated less infectious. Of course, theory is one thing and practice another. But studies in Taiwan and British Columbia (the latter by Julio Montaner, the incoming president of the International AIDS Society, which organises the conference) have shown big falls in transmission rates as ARVs have been rolled out. Meanwhile, Myron Cohen, of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is beginning a clinical trial involving 1,750 “discordant” couples (those in which one partner is infected and the other not) to see if ARVs really do reduce transmission. This trial will not report for seven years, but Dr Montaner hopes the mere likelihood that treatment also prevents transmission will spur governments to redouble their efforts to roll out ARVs and thus obtain a prevention programme at no additional cost.It was this sort of careful science—starting with a scientific hypothesis, following it up with observations in the field and ending with clinical trials—which proved that circumcision protects against infection. Indeed, amid the gloom about microbicides and vaccines, circumcision is the one bright spot in the field of AIDS prevention. Most forms of prevention have to be pushed on to people. But there are already parts of Africa, including South Africa, Swaziland and Zambia, where men are queuing up to have their foreskins cut off. The scientific basis of all this is that foreskin tissue is rich in a particular sort of cell that HIV likes very much. The field observation is that, within Africa, one of the two best predictors of the intensity of the epidemic in any given place is the prevalence of circumcision. The clinical trials suggest that circumcision by itself reduces a man’s chance of becoming infected by 50-60%. The upshot, according to Brian Williams of the World Health Organisation, is that if, in some ideal world, every sexually active man in sub-Saharan Africa were circumcised, 2m new infections would be avoided over the course of ten years, and 300,000 deaths prevented.The demand for circumcision seems to have caught everybody off guard. Some surprising people disapprove of the whole idea. Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, who is normally at the forefront of the anti-AIDS movement, has spoken out against it on the grounds that it might encourage men to become more promiscuous (although that does not seem to have been true of participants in clinical trials). And members of some groups who traditionally circumcise boys or teenagers as a mark of group membership seem equivocal about the idea of outsiders adopting the practice. But the main constraint is the lack of enough people trained to wield the knife cleanly and safely. Indeed, Tachi Yamada, the head of the Gates Foundation’s Global Health Programme, suggests bringing in volunteers from the rich world on a temporary basis, to clear the backlog.The other predictor of the scale of the epidemic in African countries, besides rates of circumcision, requires a rather different approach. It is the rate of what are known, delicately, as concurrent partnerships. That is, how many lovers the average individual has at any one time. In this case, changing people’s behaviour involves pushing very hard indeed.Every home should have oneBehavioural change is, in some ways, prevention’s orphan. The chiding voice saying “use a condom” or, worse, “don’t have sex with anyone other than your regular partner”, is not what most people want to hear. But, according to Helene Gayle, co-chairman of the Global HIV Prevention Working Group, which has been investigating the matter, no national epidemic has been brought under control without it.One reason for the orphan status of behaviour change is that it is seen as slightly unscientific. Dr Gayle and her colleagues are trying to change that. They have been looking at research in the field and discovered a lot of trials that attempt to borrow the methodology of medicine by using control groups. These trials quantify everyday experience and, in the round, suggest that campaigns to promote condom use, to curb promiscuity and to promote the use by drug takers of clean needles can reduce infection rates in the groups they are aimed at by 20-30%. Not, perhaps, as impressive as foreskin-amputation, but certainly a worthwhile improvement.Peter Piot, the head of UNAIDS, thinks that much more could be done in this area. Social science, even when it emphasises the “science” over the “social”, can only achieve so much. Sometimes, you just have to bring in the professionals. To that end, he and his colleagues have already had informal talks with marketing experts from Procter &amp; Gamble about getting the message over in a subtle and effective manner. Marketing people also understand that markets vary, and tailor their message accordingly.That is something that the AIDS establishment has been bad at until recently. Many countries whose epidemics have been concentrated among gay men or injecting drug users, or where prostitutes have been the centres of infection, have preferred to pretend such people did not exist and have spent money preaching to heterosexuals who are at low risk. Conversely, in places where most infected people are part of the wider population, blind eyes have been turned to the reality of the way the disease spreads heterosexually. Some countries have played down the question of concurrent partnerships, a particular cause of trouble in parts of Africa. There has also been a widespread assumption that, among married couples, the promiscuous partner is likely to be the man. Studies of discordant couples show that to be so, but much less than had been assumed. Though the data are limited, they suggest that in about a third of discordant African couples it is the woman, not the man, who is infected.The other thing people who work on AIDS have been bad about is championing this or that prevention strategy over the rest. The pro-condom versus pro-abstinence argument is a good example of that. But if one lesson has come out of the meeting, it is that you need every weapon you can lay your hands on.It is particularly odd that this was not noticed before, since the tremendous success of ARVs comes from using several of them in combination. The watchword now is “combination prevention” to go along with combination therapy. If AIDS is to be beaten back without a vaccine—which is still a big if—that is the only sensible way forward. Wars, however well financed, are won by disciplined bodies of troops, not rabbles.

Climate changeA record-making effort Mar 31st 2011, 23:20 by O.M. ON THURSDAY March 31st Richard Muller of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory gave evidence to the energy and commerce committee of America’s House of Representatives on the surface temperature record. Without having yet bothered to check, Babbage can say with some certainty that this event will be much discussed in the blogosphere—as, oddly enough, it should be. Here’s the short version of the reason why: a new and methodologically interesting study, carried out by people some of whom might have been expected to take a somewhat sceptical view on the issue, seems essentially to have confirmed the results of earlier work on the rate at which the earth’s temperature is rising. This makes suggestions that this rise is an artefact of bad measurement, or indeed a conspiracy of climatologists, even less credible than they were before.Now here’s the much longer version.There are two topics which, more than any other, can be guaranteed to set off arguments between those convinced of the reality and importance of humanity’s impact on the climate and those not so convinced. One revolves around the question of how reliable, if at all, statements about average global temperatures before about 1500 AD are. This is the so-called “hockey stick” debate. The amount of computer processing power and data storage capacity devoted to endless online discussions of the hockey stick— the subject featured in a great deal of the brouhaha over the “climategate” e-mails—must, by now, have the carbon footprint of a fair-sized Canadian city, which of course would worry one side of the argument not a whit.The second touchy topic is the instrumental record of the world’s temperature over the past 100 years or so. This is a more genuinely interesting subject, for two reasons. First: Consider a person who looks at all the non-hockey-stick evidence and arguments for thinking people are changing the climate (we won’t rehearse them now, but here’s a relevant article from The Economist last year). Imagine this person then saying “you know, that radiation balance and basic physics and ocean heat content and all the rest of that stuff looks pretty conclusive—but because I can’t say for sure whether it was warmer in 1388 than it was in 1988 or the other way round I’m going to ignore it all.” This would probably not be a person you would take very seriously. (It is because of this that the wiser sceptical voices in the hockey-stick debate do not claim that uncertainties over what, if anything, can reliably be said about mediaeval temperatures invalidate the scientific case for a strong and worrying human influence on climate. They say instead that there are a variety of statistical and other flaws in some of the reconstructions of mediaeval temperature, that some of the scientists responsible for some of these reconstructions have not behaved well, and that if that is typical of climate science then climate science in a whole is in a bad way. Thus the hockey stick becomes a sort of meta-, and indeed metastasising, argument.)If, on the other hand, you imagine a person who has looked at all the other relevant material going on to say “You know, this is all very well—but there doesn’t seem to be any conclusive evidence that the world has actually been getting warmer in a significant or surprising way over the past decades,” you might well think hmm; if that’s the case then he has a point. Evidence that the world really is warming does seem pretty apposite to the whole issue. Being able to trust the records of what thermometers spread out over the world have actually measured and the procedures by which  those records are combined into a series of average global temperatures matter rather more than the hockey-stick. Another reason is that mediaeval data (from tree rings and the like) at issue in the hockey stick debate are necessarily sparse and patchy, and coming up with really robust answers to all the relevant questions on the basis of them may well prove impossible. The data on which the contemporary surface temperature record is based, though, is rich. There are a great many temperature records in archives around the world. If you can choose records that are demonstrably reliable and combine them in an appropriate way, you should be able to get a pretty solid answer. This thus seems like an argument that could conceivably end in agreement on an important issue. Indeed, most climate scientists would say that it already has. There are three different combinations of instrumental temperature records that seek to show average surface temperatures back to 1900 or earlier. Two are American, with one produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and one by NASA; the other one is British, with data from the Met Office and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (which was the epicentre of climategate). They used many of the same raw data, but the ways in which they adjust them to remove presumed artefacts and then combine them differ. Yet they come up with very similar answers, and when they publish their figures with error estimates they come within each others’ margins of error. The fact that three different groups agree in this way would normally seem to justify relying on the result.But there are many ways in which climate science is not normal, one of which is that it matters a great deal with respect to some very expensive policy decisions. Various criticisms of the methodology and probity of the temperature records have been made, though much more often in the blogosphere than in the scientific literature. Erring on the side of extra caution is not a bad idea, and various efforts are underway to develop, corroborate and better to underpin the work on temperature records that has been done to date. One such effort is the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature programme, which Dr Muller heads. Fearless physicistsDr Muller is an astrophysicist, not a climate scientist, and was indeed seen by some as being a bit of a sceptic, in the unfortunate negative usage of the word. He is strongly spoken in his criticism of some of the behaviour revealed in the climategate e-mails, and talks admiringly of some of the amateur or non-credentialed scientists who have mounted critiques of published climate science. He also has a sort of intellectual fearlessness most often seen in physicists; when applied to other fields of endeavour this can look uncannily like a form of arrogance, perhaps because that is often what it is. The initials of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project could be read in this light, and indeed they were so interpreted by some climate scientists, who got rather bit peeved at the idea that interlopers should presume to claim a priori they were the BEST. Any arrogance they may be prone to, though, doesn’t invalidate the fearless physicists’ insights. Dr Muller’s beloved mentor, Luis Alvarez, was quite right when he and his son argued that the death of the dinosaurs had less to do with the environmental or evolutionary challenges palaeontologists concentrated on and more to do with the damn great meteorite or comet impact for which Alvarez père et fils had just found dramatic and unexpected evidence. On the other hand Dr Muller’s subsequent variation on the Alvarez's now broadly accepted contribution, which led to an unsuccessful search for a distant planet that might be directing killer comets at the earth on a regular basis, has as yet come to naught.The Berkeley approach seems based on the idea that coming out of physics, not climate science, was going to be a strength not a weakness. Rather than look at carefully (and similarly) selected subsets of the data it would look at everything available, just as astrophysicists frequently seek to survey the whole sky. Rather than using the judgement of climate scientists to make sense of the data records and what needed to be done to them, it would use well designed computer algorithms. Put together under the aegis of Novim, a non-profit group that runs environmental studies, the team gathered up a bit over half a million dollars—including $100,000 from a fund set up by Bill Gates and $150,000 from the Koch foundation, whose animosity towards action on climate change made the Berkeley project look yet more suspicious to some climate-change activists—and got to work. There was also support from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley Lab, where Dr Muller and some of his team work. It is probably fair to assume that Steve Koonin, an undersecretary of state at the energy department with whom Dr Muller has served as one of the “Jasons”, a group of particularly intellectually fearless scientists which provides blue-sky and sometimes far-out advice to the defence department, and who has also produced a report for Novim, had an unofficial eye on what was going on. Dr Muller’s testimony was not exactly the unveiling of his team’s first results—you can find him saying much the same in a seminar on the web— but it was a particularly high-level early outing. It was also a strikingly robust defence of the record as others have interpreted it. Calling the three extant groups “excellent”, Dr Muller described preliminary work by the Berkeley team on the overall magnitude and course of recent warming that backed them up. Instead of picking a relatively small number of weather stations to look at, this work simply took 2% of all the records the Berkeley group has access to at random. The results look very like what the other three teams have seen. The Berkeley team says that it has run such 2% experiments a number of times now, and the results are robust. The earth has warmed by about 0.7°C since 1957, just as the other teams claimed. Adjustments made to the data on a site-by-site basis which have had some suspicious sceptics hopping mad seem to have made no appreciable difference.The Watts and whereforesDr Muller also, more controversially, reported on results that pertain to a specific point made by climate sceptics; that the temperature record is contaminated because many of the stations used to compile it are in inappropriately located. This idea is particularly associated with Anthony Watts, a former television weatherman who runs an extremely popular website catering largely to a climate-sceptic crowd. Mr Watts has led an impressive crowdsourcing movement devoted to checking out the meteorological stations that generate climate data in America. This has found that a really surprising number of the instruments concerned are not sited in the way that they should be, being inappropriately close to buildings, tarmac and other things that could cause problems.A compendium of Mr Watts’s concerns was published early last year by the Science and Public Policy Insitute, which specialises in airing doubts about climate science and policy, under the title “Surface Temperature Records: Policy Driven Deception?” Dr Muller’s answer to that question in front of Congress was pretty clearly no. The Berkeley team compared the data from the American sites Mr Watts thought were worst situated and the sites he thought best. It found no statistically significant difference in the trends measured in the two different categories, though the warming trend in the better sites is slightly stronger. This analysis echoes one carried out last year by scientists at NOAA, which when looking at a subset of Mr Watts’s data found much the same thing. The Berkeley team’s result, though, is perhaps more striking, in that Mr Watts had made all his data available to Mr Muller and his colleagues, a step he seems now rather to regret. Impressed by the Berkeley set up, Mr Watts wrote in a post published March 6th:    I’m prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong. I’m taking this bold step because the method has promise. So let’s not pay attention to the little yippers who want to tear it down before they even see the results. I haven’t seen the global result, nobody has, not even the home team, but the method isn’t the madness that we’ve seen from NOAA, NCDC, GISS, and CRU, and, there aren’t any monetary strings attached to the result that I can tell. If the project was terminated tomorrow, nobody loses jobs, no large government programs get shut down, and no dependent programs crash either. That lack of strings attached to funding, plus the broad mix of people involved especially those who have previous experience in handling large data sets gives me greater confidence in the result being closer to a bona fide ground truth than anything we’ve seen yet.Responding to Dr Muller’s testimony, Mr Watts e-mailed that when he shared his data he “was expecting a study done by peer review, months out, not a job rushed in three weeks for political theater in the House of Representatives.” Though some of his results and conclusions were published in “Policy Driven Deception?” he has since worked on a peer-reviewed publication, sensible to the accusation often levelled at his blog that such publication is the way to do proper science. That this is not what the Berkeley team did, choosing instead to present preliminary results to Congress, has upset him, and he has asked to have a statement of his own read into the congressional record. The Berkeley team, for its part, argues that while it would rather publish in a peer-reviewed journal before discussing its results, and has “begun the submission process to do this”, an invitation to address the committee deserved what the team saw as the best available answers. Mr Watts’s paper, on which he has a number of co-authors including climate scientist Roger Pielke Sr, is now said to be close to the end of its road towards publication. It claims to find that there is indeed a difference between the good and bad sites: though they may provide indistinguishable results for trends in average temperature, they differ when you look at trends in minimum and maximum temperatures, which has implications for the diurnal temperature range. It is not clear what the climatological significance of this might be, and it is always worth bearing in mind that these data only apply to stations in America, which is a fairly small part of the planet. Overall, the takeaway from Dr Muller’s presentation of his team’s data is that, in the words of one climate scientist, a “Koch-brothers-funded study confirms the previous temperature reconstructions.” Dr Muller says the team will now be looking into a number of other effects, including the bias that the “urban heat island” effect—cities are warmer than surrounding countryside—might have. The question of good versus bad location is linked to this (a good site can become bad as a city sprawls over it) and so is the issue of which records you choose to use (long records, preferred by earlier reconstructions, may be more prone to changing urbanisation around them). But there is more to the problem, and Dr Muller hopes to look into it further, as well as into issues that might arise from the times of day at which observations are made, stations moving from one place to another, and changes in the instrumentation used. The Berkeley work, especially after it is published and disseminated in full, may increase the acceptance of the reality of global warming among people who have so far managed to maintain a comforting and sometimes self-serving feeling that maybe the people who deny that anything is going on are actually right. It doesn’t in itself show how much of the warming is due to human activity. Dr Muller, in a somewhat cavalier way, chose to suggest that about half of what had been seen since 1900 was. Other scientists would put the proportion higher. Nor does it say how much warming is yet to come. Carbon dioxide and other widespread gases can warm the earth, but dust, smog, sulphate particles and other things can cool it. There is no very reliable record of how these cooling factors changed over the 20th century, but they must have played a role. So you can’t simply look at temperature changes over the 20th century, and scale them up according to the amount of carbon dioxide you expect, to find out what will happen next. Though Dr Muller, in his testimony, seems to differ on this—as might perhaps be expected for someone proud of a new contribution to the field, and hoping to make more—most climate scientists do not believe that further improvements in the accuracy of the average temperature record over the twentieth century will add greatly to their ability to predict the magnitude or timing of the changes to come.But broader agreement that the temperature has indeed risen quite steeply over the past century is nevertheless a thing worth having. If the Berkeley team can help provide it, that is all to the good.

Climate policyAre economists erring on climate change?Feb 9th 2011, 21:18 by R.A. | WASHINGTONIn an interesting piece at the environmental publication Grist, David Roberts looks at the way in which climate scientists and economists often butt heads over policy recommendations. The scientists, he says, continue to pull in new data on the pace of change and suggest that catastrophe may loom if the world doesn't make drastic cuts to emissions by the middle of the century. Economists, on the other hand, tend to be more optimistic about humanity's ability to weather (pardon) change and adapt. The analyses of an economist like William Nordhaus indicate that climate change will only slightly reduce growth rates over the long run, and so only minimal steps are justified now to mitigate the impact of greenhouse has emissions.But how does one square such a sanguine take with the apocalyptic findings from those studying the earth's climate? Mr Roberts highlights a couple of factors. One is the economist's assumption that growth will continue, such that future populations will be much richer than we are right now and will therefore be better able to handle the impacts of climate change. Of course, for this to be true, one has to assume that climate change itself won't disrupt growth by too much. And one has to shrug off hypotheses like Tyler Cowen's, which suggest that growth rates have slowed since the 1970s and may continue to underperform the expectations we developed during the 20th century.But the profession isn't united behind the view that everything will be ok. Mr Roberts goes on:    [Economists] will admit that their models aren't very good at incorporating large short-term shocks. The "long tail" possibilities in climate science -- the low-probability, high-impact stuff like ice shelves collapsing or  thermohaline circulation shutting down -- completely borks the models. You start seeing wild, arbitrary swings in model projections based on small adjustments in input assumptions. The models start saying, in essence, "hell if I know!" (Economist Martin Weitzman has done good work on this; Romm has a digestible summary.)    When economists run into the limitations of their models, they tend to heed the Wittgensteinian injunction: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. They don't feel comfortable making policy recommendations without solid modeling to back it up. Giving counsel in the face gigantic, unquantifiable risks starts to feel less like science and more like an exercise in politics or ethics. Heaven forbid.Let me just add a few thoughts. Economists are by nature conservative, with a small c, in the sense that they're reluctant to endorse big policy shifts without clear evidence of the benefits. And it's difficult to be sure of the trade-offs involved in these recommended policy choices. Modeling the impact of climate change on weather patterns is difficult enough, without then extending that analysis to forecast effects on things like crop yields and water supplies, and thence on to GDP growth rates. Economists want to be careful. They're also concerned that efforts to boost green investments may lead to boondoggles rather than valuable new technologies. If they can't be sure that resources shifted from normal private investments toward government-sponsored alternative technologies will pay off in big drops in emissions, then they'll often opt for what they see as the safe route—normal market economy activity and growth.Others recommend adopting some policies now as an insurance policy against apocalyptic tail outcomes. That seems sensible, but it's still difficult to know what level of insurance is appropriate to purchase. If you can confidently answer how much the world should pay to avoid apocalypse, then you've gone a long way toward answering how much the world should pay to achieve an optimum level of climate mitigation, and obviously economists haven't gotten to that point yet.In the face of this uncertainty, many economists nonetheless remain reasonably optimistic, and not entirely without reason. A half century is a very long time. Economies tend to be very flexible over such long time frames. Populations are highly mobile during that kind of window—think about how Detroit has emptied out since 1980. Consumption baskets and technologies can respond well over a five-decade period. I'm probably as confident as anyone that given current temperature projections, measured output won't perform badly at all through 2050, or even through 2100.But there are a few caveats worth noting. One is that economic resiliency can co-exist quite easily with significant levels of human suffering:    Un-mitigated climate change is going to be like Operation Rolling Thunder. A lot of people are going to die. A lot of people are going to be maimed. A lot of existing physical infrastructure will be destroyed. The extent to which pulverizing Vietnam with high explosives didn’t alter the country’s long-term trajectory is fascinating, but obviously constitutes cold comfort to mothers with dead children or people with no legs. As Kahn notes, the negative impact of climate change will fall disproportionately on the global poor and the elderly. If the entire population of Bangladesh dropped dead tomorrow, per capita GDP would go up. A 20 percent increase in the death rate of Americans over the age of 65 would cause our per capita growth rate to accelerate. It’s important to understand these facts, but it’s strange to think of them as optimistic scenarios...Another is that unlike economies, political systems can be quite brittle. When you look at historical Jared Diamond collapse scenarios, what you see is that they're hyper-local. A complex society develops within a local environment, and when the local environmental conditions change the society collapses. But in the modern world, even substantial local environmental collapses tend not to lead to societal implosion. If Chinese crops fail, China doesn't end; it imports grain from elsewhere. But the ability to limit the damage of modern crises depends upon the institutions that support a liberal global economy, and institutions aren't always as flexible as economies. The world has this marvelous grain market, but if price increases lead to export-restrictions then that grain market suddenly fails. And if the grain markets fail, the unstable governments kept in place only by their ability to keep local markets provisioned fall. And if the governments fall, the refugees will seek asylum elsewhere, and if that happens then borders will be overwhelmed, and who knows what conflicts may erupt.In other words, I feel fairly comfortable arguing that a modern economy can handle the stresses of climate change reasonably well; economies are built to handle big change. I feel very nervous about the ability of various political systems to survive temperatures unprecedented in human history. Many political systems rely explicitly on stability to survive, and even those capable of handling climate impacts may struggle to handle the knock-on effects of climate impacts on their more vulnerable neighbours. And as political systems are disrupted, it will become more difficult to sustain growth.But how exactly does one model that? It's very difficult to say. So should governments do as some climate scientists recommend and begin plowing money into deployment of green power generation? Well, that's not clear either; there are opportunity costs to doing so. This needn't be a recipe for paralysis, however. Economists and climate scientists can certainly agree on many things that should be done: carbon pricing, elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, subsidisation of basic research, and so on. But then one is forced to confront the problem that Washington doesn't appear to be interested in optimal policies.At this point, environmentalists shift to arguing that the economist's reticence plays an outright pernicious role. Because economists are too conservative to call for ambitious building programmes without more clarity on the trade-offs, it's argued, they convey to policymakers that the situation is not, in fact, that dire. If economists were running around with their hair on fire, Congress might respond.I'm sceptical. Economists aren't always very successful at getting the policies they want, and when they are, it's often because their prescriptions fit the goals of established interests. That's clearly not the case here. All the same, it seems clear that economists have yet to put together a satisfactory analytical framework for addressing the climate crisis. Well-meaning political leaders need better ways of thinking about how to manage the trade-offs involved, and economists aren't yet providing them. If they can't do better, policy will ultimately either fall short of what's necessary, or run off in other directions unguided by their recommendations.

Global warmingClimate change and evolutionJan 24th 2011, 14:31 by M.S. The EconomistOur topics this morning are global warming, evolution and feathers. Let's start with the warming. Despite a frenzied last-minute drive involving snowstorms in Europe and the eastern United States, planet Earth failed to save itself from another last-place finish in 2010: once again, it was the least cold year on record. The World Meteorological Organization announced its finding last week that global mean temperatures for the year were 0.53°C above the 1961-1990 mean, 0.01°C warmer than 2005 and 0.02°C above 1998. With the comparison having a margin of uncertainty of 0.09°C, the three years are considered tied for the hottest year on record. That followed results the previous week from NOAA, which found 2010 and 2005 tied as the hottest years ever, and NASA, which found the same thing. (They both think 1998 was a bit colder.)By itself, as we always say, one hot year doesn't prove anything. The fact that every one of the twelve hottest years on record has come since 1997 is a little harder to wave away. 2010 was also the wettest year ever, corresponding to the expectation that higher heat means more water vapour. More countries set national high-temperature records in 2010 than ever before, including the biggest one, Russia. Arctic sea ice in December was at its lowest level ever, temperatures across a broad swathe of northern Canada have been 20° C higher than normal for the past month, the record temperatures are coming despite the lowest levels of solar activity in a century and a La Nina effect that should be making Canada colder rather than warmer, and so on. It is of course possible that global warming plateaued this year; it's also possible that it plateaued this morning. One can always hope! For now, though, this is the basic shape of things:Temperature recordsThe George Will "global warming has ended" moment shows up as that little dip towards the end, before it returns to trend. So, what effect will the new data have on that meme? Quite possibly none. People who tried to cast doubt on global warming in 2009 based on a few years one could isolate so that they didn't show a discernible trend will now no doubt respond that a couple of very hot years don't prove anything. Which underlines how often the conclusions one draws from data are determined by a combination of the hypotheses you're framing, and at what point you start looking.This brings me to the feathers. In this month's National Geographic, Carl Zimmer sums up recent paleontological progress in figuring out when and how feathers evolved, and how they fit into the relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Apparently there have been tons of new feather-bearing fossils unearthed over the past 15 years, and scientists can now use microscopic analysis and knowledge of how modern feathers work to actually figure out what color some of the feathers on these dinosaurs were. It's pretty clear that the development of feathers came long before they had anything to do with flight, but it's still not so clear whether feathered dinosaurs evolved into birds or whether they (and feathered proto-crocodiles!) shared a common feathered ancestor. Anyway, towards the beginning of the article comes this:   The origin of this wonderful mechanism is one of evolution's most durable mysteries. In 1861, just two years after Darwin published Origin of Species, quarry workers in Germany unearthed spectacular fossils of a crow-size bird, dubbed Archaeopteryx, that lived about 150 million years ago. It had feathers and other traits of living birds but also vestiges of a reptilian past, such as teeth in its mouth, claws on its wings, and a long, bony tail. Like fossils of whales with legs, Archaeopteryx seemed to capture a moment in a critical evolutionary metamorphosis. "It is a grand case for me," Darwin confided to a friend.Think about how that must have looked to contemporaries. Darwin publishes his theory that species develop through evolution from other species. Okay, many people think, wild idea, but can one species really change so deeply over time that it becomes a different species? Wolves into dogs, sure, but fish into lizards and so forth? Then, two years later, a fossil is discovered that suggests dinosaurs evolving into birds. To first have a theory presented that suggests these outlandish transformations, and then to have an example turn up that perfectly describes the theory's most improbable consequences, with no possibility of prior knowledge—this is an extremely convincing sequence of evidence.But if you grew up, say, 150 years after "The Origin of Species" was published, you didn't experience that remarkable sequence of evidence. You get the theory of evolution and the fossil background presented at the same time. So if you want to be an evolution sceptic, the fossil record just becomes another set of data you can poke holes in, along with the theory. After all, nobody understands what function feathers served before they were used for flight. If they were for mating displays, why did they turn out to be perfect for aerodynamics? How come nothing has feathers anymore that doesn't fly, or isn't descended from something that did? Darwin's theory can't explain it! And so on.Now, back to global warming. For me, or anyone older, the thesis that rising global temperature data were due to a greenhouse effect produced by industrial emissions of CO2 and other gases, and that this might lead to environmental disaster, was something we first encountered as a mind-bending idea being thrown around by scientists in the mid-1980s. The first time we heard a scientist authoritatively state that the evidence was in, and that global warming was real, was when James Hansen said it while presenting his research to Congress in 1988. That was a daring claim for Mr Hansen to make at that point. It was daring because it was very clearly falsifiable. If, after 1988, global temperatures had stopped rising, or had started to exhibit a lot of volatility—if there had been a decade-long cooling episode, such as the world saw in the late 1930s and 40s—then Mr Hansen would have been discredited. But that didn't happen. Instead, for a decade and a half after Mr Hansen made the call, global mean temperatures kept going up and up. They bounced around a bit in the mid-2000s, and have now resumed rising again.For people my age or older who were paying attention over the past couple of decades, that really ought to be convincing. But for people who just joined the conversation when "An Inconvenient Truth" came out, things are different. For them, the evidence of global warming was presented at the same time as the theory. And so they're susceptible to people trying to poke holes in the data or the theory. The temperature rise from 1998-2008 isn't statistically significant, tree ring data is unreliable, and so forth. Give them another two decades, and they'll probably come around. Unfortunately, by that time an enormous amount of damage will already have been done.As to why George Will buys this stuff, I have no explanation. Maybe, in the internet age, we're all effectively getting our memories wiped every week or two, and it's as if we don't remember the sequence of events; everything is presented simultaneously. Or maybe we selectively wipe our own memories of the sequence of events when they threaten to prove inconvenient to our interests or our ideological predispositions.

Pollution and global warmingClimate change in black and whiteWhen air pollution hurts people’s health and heats up the climate it makes sense to do something about it. But what about pollution that cools the planet?Feb 17th 2011 | from the print editionAn ideal fossil-fuel power-plant would produce power, carbon dioxide and nothing more. Less-than-ideal ones—not to mention other devices for the combustion of carbon, from diesel generators to brick kilns and stoves burning dung—also emit various gases and gunk. These often cause local environmental problems, damaging lungs, hurting crops and shortening lives. And some of the gunk, notably soot or “black carbon”, can warm the planet, too.Next week ministers attending the governing council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi will be presented with the summary of a new report on how fighting air pollution can help the global climate (the report itself is due to follow a couple of months later). The summary makes a powerful case for acting on two short-lived climate “forcings”, factors that change the amount of energy the atmosphere absorbs, as carbon dioxide does, but stay in it only briefly. One is black carbon and the other is ozone, which is vital for blocking ultraviolet rays in the stratosphere but hazardous in the bits of the atmosphere where plants live and people have to breathe.According to the UNEP report, implementing measures known to be effective against these two pollutants over the next 20 years would have “immediate and multiple” benefits, including temperatures between 0.2°C and 0.7°C lower than they would otherwise be by 2050 and the saving of between 0.7m and 4.6m lives with improved air quality. For black carbon the measures are largely in the form of more efficient ways of burning things; for ozone they mostly involve reducing emissions of methane, which encourages reactions in the atmosphere that make ozone. The black-carbon measures save a lot more lives than ozone control, but are trickier to assess in terms of climate.Related topicsClearing the airUNEP’s interest in black carbon dates back to a plane journey taken a decade ago. Veerabhadran Ramanathan, of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, and Paul Crutzen, a Dutch climate scientist who was one of the first to theorise about “nuclear winter”, wanted to find out what aerosols (particles small enough to float in the atmosphere) were doing to the climate. Their campaign, which brought together 150 scientists and a plethora of research aircraft and satellites, revealed the hitherto unappreciated extent of an “Asian brown cloud” thousands of kilometres across and fed by fires, diesel fumes and all manner of other things.In 2001 Dr Ramanathan took Klaus Töpfer, then UNEP’s executive director, on a flight along the foothills of the Himalayas to see the brown cloud lapping at the mountain range like dirty water at the rim of a bathtub. From that day on UNEP has taken a keen interest in the issue. Now, according to its current executive director, Achim Steiner, the science of short-lived climate changers has matured enough for the issue to deserve a place at the top of the policy agenda.One aspect of this maturity is that short-lived forcings have become relevant to more people as the scale of their effects has been recognised. This is particularly true for black carbon. Soon after coining the term “Asian brown cloud”, Dr Ramanathan realised there were similar if less intense clouds over parts of Africa and elsewhere; the initials ABC, already used by researchers, were retrofitted to stand for “atmospheric brown cloud” (which also appeased some political sensibilities).Another reason for the increased interest in all this has less to do with science than politics. Negotiations under the UN’s climate-change convention have had some limited success in getting countries to say they will cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases. But even if these cuts make the crucial transition from word to deed, they are too small to give the world much of a chance of staying below two degrees of warming, which is the level currently seen, somewhat arbitrarily, as the climate’s don’t-even-go-there line. Action on short-lived things like black carbon and ozone could help keep the climate on the right side of that line for a few decades longer. That does not do much about the need to cut carbon-dioxide emissions for long-term safety, but it might provide a few decades of grace (see chart).And doing something about these short-lived forcings is easier than tackling carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is an essential by-product of burning fossil fuels, controlling it is a big economic issue. And because it lasts a long time and is evenly mixed around the planet, action on emissions in, say, America and China is directly comparable. This leads to the sort of burden-sharing negotiations that easily get deadlocked. Short-lived forcings have the advantage of being comparatively cheap to cut: for black carbon tried and true measures include retiring old vehicles, filtering exhausts, getting people better stoves and cleaner fuel to burn in them, stopping widespread burning of agricultural waste, and modernising kilns and coking ovens. The benefits in terms of breathing better and dying later accrue mostly to the country that is doing the cutting.But some of the effects of things like ABCs tend to be regional. So countries need to work together in a number of different ways—including regional agreements, bilateral aid and comparisons of best practice. UNEP already either facilitates or functions as the secretariat for about a dozen regional pollution agreements. More venues and more instruments to work with should help climate diplomacy move beyond its endless who-should-do-more arguments. David Victor, who works on energy and environmental policy at the University of California, San Diego, argues that seeing positive results relatively quickly from co-operation on things like black carbon could actually increase the levels of trust and ambition seen in negotiations about carbon dioxide—a good thing.Clouding the issuesThe science may have matured, but the role that black carbon and other aerosols play in the changing climate is still rife with nuance, uncertainty and doubt. Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development and an adviser to UNEP, says these are normally things which frighten policymakers. But he believes the new report lays out the uncertainties clearly while still making a compelling case for action.Climate forcings are, for the sake of comparison, expressed in terms of watts per square metre: more watts, more warming. The forcing due to the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by people over the past few centuries is put at 1.7 watts per square metre. Other greenhouse gases add another watt. Dr Ramanathan puts the figure for black carbon at something like 0.9 watts per square metre, on the basis of observations, with a range of possible values that goes from 0.4 watts per square metre to 1.2. Climate modellers tend to find values near the bottom of that range; this may mean the models are underestimating the amount of black carbon being emitted, or that Dr Ramanathan’s figure is too high.The effect may be amplified, or reduced, by many factors. Black carbon is not emitted alone, but mixed with other things—organic molecules and various oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. These can form less-black particles that reflect, rather than absorb, the sun’s energy. These paler aerosols, and to some extent the blacker ones too, can provide sites for water to condense. That promotes the formation of clouds, which reflect sunlight back into space. These are some of the reasons why, though the black carbon in brown clouds has a warming effect, the clouds’ net effect is to cool the planet beneath them.When such a layer of pollutants warms the atmosphere (because of its black-carbon content) but cools the surface, it can have effects well beyond any net warming or cooling. If the surface is cooled and the air above it warmed, there is less tendency for air from near the surface to rise; reduced convection will tend to lead to fewer clouds and reduced rainfall. This sort of change matters more, for a lot of purposes, than the surface temperature. It was an extreme version of this rainless cold-below, warm-above stability that made early models of nuclear winter so disturbing.All this means that no one can say exactly how much warming will be avoided by acting on black carbon. If it were not for the clouds, says Tami Bond of the University of Illinois, most experts would expect a cooling from steps to reduce black carbon even if those steps also reduced emissions of organic compounds and other cooling aerosols. But given the effects on cloud formation and dissipation (a cloud laced with black carbon does not last as long) the potential for error in estimating the final effects is large. Dr Bond is one of the lead authors of an ambitious attempt to assess observations and models of black carbon, and quantify their uncertainties, that should be published shortly.The UNEP report puts the average global cooling that could be achieved with black-carbon control measures at 0.3 watts per square metre, taking into account all the cloud effects and other complications. But Drew Shindell, who works on aerosols and climate at NASA and is the chair for the UNEP report, cautions that the range of possible effects runs from twice that much to nothing at all. There is even an outside chance that the proposed black-carbon action could lead to a little warming, though if that were the case the actions on ozone would still provide a net cooling for the package of actions as a whole.This is why, Mr Zaelke says, it is important to appreciate the regional and local effects too. Dr Ramanathan has amassed a range of evidence that ABCs, the regional effects of which are far greater than global averages, have depressed rainfall in the Indian monsoon over the past decades. Other researchers think the presence of the pollution has an effect within individual monsoon seasons, too, changing patterns of rainfall.The brown cloud in action over IndiaBlack carbon has particularly pernicious effects on frozen regions. When it falls on snow it greatly increases the amount of sunlight absorbed. Black carbon slopping over India’s bathtub rim represents a threat to Asia’s high glaciers. Studies of an ice core from Mount Everest show that from 1975 to 2000 the black carbon rose threefold. The Arctic has been warming faster than other places, and faster than models tend to predict. Black carbon from America, Asia and, predominantly, Europe is likely to be one of the reasons. The Arctic Council, which brings together the eight nations with Arctic territories and representatives of indigenous people, has had a working group on short-lived forcings for some time. The council’s foreign ministers may announce some sort of action on black carbon when they meet in Nuuk, Greenland, in May.Double effectsIf the Arctic is warming faster than might be expected, other parts of the world are warming slower. One reason for this, widely accepted by scientists but little appreciated by policymakers, is the sulphur given off by coal-fired power stations and some other industrial fossil-fuel use. Sulphur is very good at forming reflecting aerosols that can also make natural clouds both whiter and possibly longer-lasting, which provides an added cooling effect.Icebreaker or icemaker?Uncertainty about how strong these effects are is one reason why it is frustratingly hard to use the 20th century’s climate trends to predict those of the 21st: no one knows how much greenhouse warming in decades past was masked by the cooling effects of sulphate and other aerosols. It is telling, say some scientists, that global warming was at its most marked from the 1970s to the 1990s, roughly the time when Europe and North America got serious about cleaning up smokestack sulphur. Year-on-year warming slackened in the 2000s—at a time when China’s burning of coal for electricity, and its emissions of sulphur, went through the roof, reversing the downward global trend of the previous decades. Coincidence is not causation. But an analysis by Dr Shindell and his colleague Gregory Faluvegi suggests that a typical coal-fired power station in China will take three decades to produce enough carbon dioxide to overpower the initial cooling effects of its sulphates.This may sound like a free solution to global warming—but not if you have to breathe China’s air. Pollution is leading to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths a year. The Chinese government is at the same time dirigiste and susceptible to some sorts of public pressure: it has programmes for reducing pollution and has more sulphur scrubbers installed on its plants than America does, though it is not clear how many are in use (they reduce a plant’s efficiency). In an ever richer China greater action on sulphur seems all but inevitable, and some sort of air-pollution equivalent of 2008’s tainted-milk crisis might bring it about precipitously. At that point the warming effects of recent fossil-fuel emissions will be unmasked.Something similar is going on at sea. After decades of increasing sulphur emissions by ships, the International Maritime Organisation is reversing the trend by regulating the sulphur content of fuels. Analysis by independent scientists suggests this will save tens of thousands of lives in coastal areas, but could add something like 0.3 watts per square metre of warming—a significant amount. All told, action to get sulphur out of the atmosphere, which is justified on health grounds, could easily warm the world as much, or more, than removing black carbon cools it.So, what to do about such conundrums? Regulators mostly ignore them; reducing pollution by things like sulphates has been the goal of clear-air legislation around the world for decades, and finding a downside now would not be helpful. Even if one could compare the number of lives lost through action or inaction, a Kantian squeamishness about means and ends might properly stop people acting on the conclusions. For the present, then, the issues are mostly passed over in silence.One voice that has been raised, though, is that of Dr Crutzen, who worked with Dr Ramanathan on that first study of brown clouds. Now and then volcanoes produce sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere which last far longer than those created by industrial pollution lower down in the atmosphere—they have lifetimes of years, rather than days or weeks. This longer life means that in terms of cooling per gram, sulphur in the stratosphere outdoes the lower-down stuff by about 25 to 1. So if you were to inject a comparatively small amount of sulphate into the stratosphere while phasing out all industrial emissions lower down, Dr Crutzen noted in a paper published five years ago, you could keep today’s cooling levels while getting huge health benefits.The technical, environmental, political and moral pros and cons of such “geoengineering” have been widely discussed since. The idea gained a lot of credibility from the fact that although Dr Crutzen is one of the people who first warned of man-made damage to the stratosphere’s ozone layer—work which won him a Nobel prize—he is not overly worried that added sulphates would add significantly to the damage. But little of the discussion has focused on one of the two key ideas on which Dr Crutzen’s argument was built: that geoengineering could solve the problem of pollution-control measures that save people but warm the planet.The other key foundation was desperation. Despite years of warning, Dr Crutzen saw action on carbon-dioxide emissions getting nowhere; it seemed as if something else was necessary. A similar analysis underlies moves to step up action on short-lived forcings, though here the fresh approach is intrinsically attractive, rather than scary. In fact, geoengineering and action on short-lived forcings have a lot in common. Both might sap urgency from efforts to control carbon dioxide; both raise large uncertainties; both can come about through the work of just a few nations; both throw a light on the nature of human responsibility for the climate. Most people see climate change as an incidental side-effect when caused by burning fossil fuels. If it were engineered by intentionally putting sulphate into the stratosphere they would judge it to be deliberate. But what of reducing the level of sulphates emitted by ships, knowing it is likely to warm the planet? Is that deliberate or incidental?It is no coincidence that a non-governmental organisation active in the fight against air pollution, America’s Clean Air Task Force, now strongly advocates more research into the pros and cons of geoengineering. Jason Blackstock, at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Canada, points out that black carbon, sulphates and geoengineering are all neglected by the institutions that govern climate policy. He is looking at ways to bring the topics together in the broader context of how nations make choices about the climate. If human action on the climate is ever to be properly deliberate, it must first be properly deliberated.

LexingtonThe politics of hip-hopCan rap change the world?Illustration by David SimondsJun 26th 2008 | From The Economist print edition“Writing about music is like dancing about architecture,” intoned Elvis Costello, a pop star. So a columnist approaches the subject of hip-hop (which includes rap) with caution. One cannot hope to capture its sound or fury on the page. Instead, Lexington will ask what it signifies. Is it “pavement poetry [that] vibrates with commitment to speaking for the voiceless,” as Michael Eric Dyson, a professor at Georgetown University, believes? Is it “an enormously influential agent for social change which must be responsibly and proactively utilised to fight the war on poverty and injustice,” as the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network (HSAN), a pressure group, contends? Or is it mostly “angry, profane and women-hating…music that plays on the worst stereotypes of black people,” as Bill Cosby harrumphs?None of the above, argues John McWhorter, in a new book called “All About the Beat: Why Hip-Hop Can’t Save Black America”. Mr McWhorter, a fellow of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank, is a hip-hop fan. He likens the group OutKast to Stravinsky. He admits that some hip-hop lyrics display an ungentlemanly attitude towards women, but he doubts that listening to violent lyrics causes people to behave more violently. If it did, there would be more opera fans stabbing their ex-lovers outside bullfights.Mr McWhorter also thinks people take hip-hop far too seriously. Those who disapprove of it vastly overestimate its capacity to corrupt. And those who expect it to foster a political revolution that will dramatically improve the lot of black Americans are going to be disappointed.The most popular rappers are brilliant entertainers. They have also done a lot to make people aware of the difficulties facing poor urban blacks. But their political views are neither particularly acute nor central to their work. Consider the hot album of the moment: “Tha Carter III” by Lil Wayne. Its central message is that if you are a rap star, you will get laid. The song “Lollipop”, for example, celebrates a young lady who treats Lil Wayne as she might a lollipop.On the last track Lil Wayne does get serious. He laments that “one in every nine black Americans are locked up” and that “the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail…would be less to send his or her young ass to college.” Troy Nkrumah, the chairman of the National Hip-Hop Political Convention, thinks it wonderful that Lil Wayne is speaking truth to power. But if Lil Wayne is to be taken seriously, it needs to be pointed out that his “one in nine” figure is inaccurate—it is true only of black men aged 20-34, not black Americans in general. And his analysis is simplistic: the government’s spending priorities are not the sole determinant of whether you break rocks or read books.Earnest hip-hop fans often argue that “commercial” rappers such as Lil Wayne are beside the point. Hip-hop’s revolutionary potential is best expressed by “conscious” rappers who focus on important issues rather than babes, bling and booze. The Roots, a group from Philadelphia, are often cited as an example. Their message? “If I can’t work to make it, I’ll rob and take it. Either that or me and my children are starving and naked.”But crime and starvation are hardly the only options. Even without a high-school diploma, a black man can probably find a job if he looks. And some manual jobs, such as plumber or cable technician, pay quite well. “It may well be that you can’t write much of a rap about training someone to fix heaters or air conditioners,” sighs Mr McWhorter.Conscious rappers are often well-meaning. Dead Prez, a duo from Florida, sometimes toss apples into the audience to encourage healthy eating. But when it comes to more contentious political issues, hip-hop offers no plausible solutions; only impotent and sometimes self-destructive rage. In “Lost in tha System” by Da Lench Mob, for example, the vocalist says, of a judge: “He added on another year cos I dissed him. Now here I go gettin’ lost in the system.” The disrespect in question was a suggestion that the judge perform fellatio on him.Fans love rappers partly because they strike such a confrontational pose. Dead Prez sometimes burn dollar bills to protest the evils of capitalism, and their lyrics accuse teachers of teaching “white man lies”. Mr McWhorter summarises the message of hip-hop as: “Things will keep sucking until there is a revolution where the white man finally understands and does a complete 180-degree turn.” This was true half a century ago in the segregated South. But today, it is nonsense.The limits of protestSome people argue that hip-hop is politically consequential because activists can use the music and the culture that surrounds it to communicate with young people who might otherwise shun politics. There is something to this. For example, in 2004 the superstar P. Diddy fronted a fairly successful voter-registration campaign called “Vote or Die”. And HSAN once co-sponsored a rally to protest about a proposed $300m cut to the New York City school budget. The cut never happened. HSAN trumpets this as a great victory. But it is hardly evidence that hip-hop can change the world. That $300m is a tiny slice of what New York spends on its schools, and lack of money is far from the main obstacle to improving them.Civil-rights activists in the 1960s were inspired by protest songs, but the songs did not drive the movement. Political change requires hard and often tedious work, as the thousands of weary volunteers working for Barack Obama can attest. Incidentally, one might think that Mr Obama’s spectacular rise undermines the argument that a black man can never get a fair shake in America. But Mr Nkrumah shrugs that even if Mr Obama is elected president, he will be powerless to implement progressive policies because the corporate power structure will not let him.

Music industryHow to sink piratesThe decline of music piracy holds lessons for other industriesNov 12th 2009 | From The Economist print editionIllustration by Claudio MunozYou open a window on your computer’s screen. You type in the name of a cheesy song from the 1980s. A list of results appears. You double-click on one of them, and within a few seconds the song is playing. This is what it was like to use Napster a decade ago; and it is also how Spotify, another free online-music service, works today. The difference? Napster was an illegal file-sharing service that was shut down by the courts. Spotify, by contrast, is an entirely legal, free service supported by advertising. This shows how much things have changed in the world of online music in the past decade. It also explains why online music piracy may at last be in decline.For most of the past decade the music industry focused on litigation to try to prevent piracy. Over the years the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has accused 18,000 internet users of engaging in illegal file-sharing. Most of them settled, though two cases went to court this year. In both cases the defendants (a single mother and a student) lost and were ordered to pay damages (of $1.92m and $675,000 respectively). But the industry has realised that such cases encourage the publication of embarrassing headlines more than they discourage piracy, for as each network was shut down, another would sprout in its place.Yet as piracy flourished on illegal networks, legal alternatives also started to appear. Apple launched its iTunes Music Store, offering downloads at $0.99 per track, in 2003. Many others have followed, including a new, above-board version of Napster. And in the past two years new music sites and services have proliferated. Spotify offers free, advertising-supported streams; paying customers are spared the ads and can use the service on smart-phones. Nokia’s Comes With Music scheme includes a year’s unlimited downloads in the price of some mobile phones. TDC, a Danish telecoms operator, bundles access to a music service with its broadband packages.All of these different, legal music services offer the “celestial jukebox”—whatever you want, right away, from the internet—that made Napster so compelling when it appeared on the scene. True, revenue from these services will be less than from CD sales, but it is much better than nothing. The recorded-music industry will get smaller—but it will not disappear.That is because there is growing evidence that this plethora of new services adds up to an attractive alternative to piracy for many (see article). In June a poll of Swedish users of file-sharing software found that 60% had cut back or stopped using it; of those, half had switched to advertising-supported streaming services like Spotify. In Denmark, over 40% of subscribers to TDC’s broadband-plus-music package also said they were making fewer illegal downloads as a result. In a British poll published in July, 17% of consumers said they used file-sharing services, down from 22% in December 2007. Music executives reckon people are moving from file-sharing networks to Spotify, though they may continue to download some music illegally.To be sure, the carrots of more attractive legal services are being accompanied by innovative forms of stick. In particular, a new approach called “graduated response” is gaining momentum. As its name indicates, it involves ratcheting up the pressure on users of file-sharing software by sending them warnings by e-mail and letter and then cutting off or throttling their internet access if they fail to respond after three requests. Graduated-response laws were introduced earlier this year in Taiwan and South Korea, and were enacted in France last month. Other countries are expected to follow suit.But mainly carrotsYet in Britain music file-sharing seems to be in decline even though a graduated-response law has yet to be introduced. The country also boasts one of the broadest selections of legal music services: Spotify and Comes With Music were both launched there before most other countries, and two of Britain’s biggest internet-service providers have borrowed TDC’s bundled-music model. This suggests that when it comes to discouraging music piracy, carrots may in fact be more important than sticks.All of this offers a lesson for other types of media, such as films and video games. Piracy thrives because it satisfies an unmet demand. The best way to discourage it is to offer a diverse range of attractive, legal alternatives. The music industry has taken a decade to work this out, but it has now done so. Other industries should benefit from its experience—and follow its example.

Music piracySinging a different tuneThe battle against online music piracy is turning. A return to growth will take a good deal longerNov 12th 2009 | From The Economist print editionRex Features“Rock and roll is dead,” sang Lenny Kravitz. It is certainly poorly. Music was the first media business to be seriously affected by piracy and has suffered most severely. Yet the prognosis is improving. While it is by no means over, the struggle against music piracy is going better than at any point since the appearance of Napster, a file-sharing service, ten years ago.It has been a brutal decade. In many countries music sales to consumers have fallen by more than a third. Even Apple’s popular digital iTunes store is little more than a niche service: fully 95% of downloads are illegal, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), a trade group. Established bands have been able to raise ticket prices in response. But by reducing the money available to sign and tout new artists, file-sharing has made it harder for bands to become established. Paul McGuinness, who manages the band U2, says the whole “starmaking apparatus” is damaged.The music business is now doing two things right. First, it has built a better stick. Most countries have virtually abandoned the practice of suing people for downloading copyrighted files. The favoured approach these days is known as “graduated response” or “three strikes and you’re out”. People who are suspected of trading media illegally are sent warnings. If they fail to stop, their internet-service provider (ISP) may slow their connection. If that fails to deter, they may be temporarily cut off.Graduated-response laws appeared this spring in Taiwan and South Korea—an advanced market where digital music has overtaken sales of CDs and DVDs. In October, following many political and legal hitches, they were enacted in France. The British government is expected to announce similar measures on November 18th. Almost everywhere in the developed world, such laws are being debated. Even where they are not (America, for example), ISPs are working quietly with the record industry to similar ends.The trouble with the old practice of suing people for swapping music is that it is slow, expensive and limited. In most countries, being prosecuted for file-sharing is a little like being struck by lightning. The exception is Germany, where a cheap, efficient legal system has made it possible to launch some 100,000 prosecutions. In the past two years the proportion of German internet users who share files illegally has dropped significantly. It now stands at 6%, according to Jupiter Research—less than in any other big European country. Graduated response ought to make it possible to reach many more people, reckons Steven Marks, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.The second change is that the industry is offering tastier carrots. These days the music associations talk less about lawsuits and more about cultivating alternatives to piracy. The past year has seen rapid growth of digital music services that accept the post-Napster consensus that music should be free, or at least appear to be free. The companies involved range from Google, which now facilitates music streaming from its search page in America, to Nokia, which bundles access to a music-download service with some of its mobile phones. “The next big thing is a dozen different things,” says Thomas Hesse of Sony Music Entertainment.The hottest product is Spotify, which has been downloaded to 6m computers in Europe. Spotify streams tracks free, interrupted by minimal advertising. Customers can pay a monthly fee to get rid of the advertisements or to install the application on iPhones and other mobile devices. Although streaming a song is not the same as owning it, Spotify has proved a compelling alternative to illegal file-sharing.Ahoy there, me heartiesThe effect is clearest in Sweden. That country incubated Spotify and The Pirate Bay, a popular website that allowed people to find pirated files easily. In April four people associated with the website were found guilty of copyright infringement. At about the same time Sweden enacted a law forcing ISPs to reveal more information about their subscribers. In the past, such legal actions have led music fans to find new ways of sharing files. Not so this time. In June a poll carried out by GfK, a market-research firm, found that 60% of Swedish file-sharers had cut back or stopped altogether. Of that group half had resorted to advertising-supported streaming.Potentially more important are the efforts of ISPs, such as Virgin and BSkyB in Britain, to sell subscriptions to broadband and music together. Internet bills are often paid by parents who may wish to remove the temptation for their children to use peer-to-peer services. Such deals should also prod ISPs into a more active role in discouraging file-sharing. They are likely to become more involved if video piracy continues to grow, in any case. Many broadband suppliers are also in the pay-television business. If Comcast ends up buying NBC Universal (see article) a broadband supplier will own a film studio.The pioneer of this model is Denmark’s incumbent telecoms firm, TDC, which offers more than 5m songs. Some 120m tracks have been downloaded so far, which works out at 22 per Dane. The tracks self-destruct shortly after a consumer lets his subscription lapse. Yet they seem to be a good enough substitute. Earlier this year more than two-fifths of TDC Play users told Megafon, a pollster, that they were downloading fewer illegal files. TDC likes the arrangement, too, because it makes customers more loyal.The recorded-music business is not about to lurch into growth. A big proportion of revenues—more than half just about everywhere—still comes from CD albums, which are gradually falling out of favour. Start-ups like Spotify need to turn more freeloaders into paying subscribers if they are to survive and start providing a serious income stream to record companies and artists. And there are still plenty of ways of sneakily copying music.John Kennedy, head of the IFPI, points out that piracy was rife even before file-sharing. The goal is not to eradicate it—that is impossible—but to tilt the playing field towards legitimate services. That finally seems to be happening.

Sound as a weaponTurn that noise offThe use and misuse of soundFeb 16th 2008 | From The Economist onlineShutterstockMusic has the power to delight the listener, improve well-being and uplift the soul. But sounds have more malign uses too. The beauty of the music produced by the Sirens of ancient Greek legend drew unwary sailors to their doom on the rocks. And in Britain calls have been made this week to ban the use of the Mosquito, a high-pitched-noise generator that is used to disperse groups of unruly teenagers from congregating points such as shopping centres and housing estates. Campaigners say that it is unfair to subject the young to a discomforting sound that only they can detect—older ears are no longer sensitive enough to detect the Mosquito’s din.The aural assault on Britain’s potentially troublesome youth is not the first. Over ten years ago stations on the Tyne and Wear Metro were equipped with speakers that blasted out classical music. Mozart and Beethoven did the job of dispersing or calming hooligans so successfully that London Underground later adopted the idea too. Australian authorities used a similar technique by playing cheesy music, such as Barry Manilow, deemed so “uncool” by suburban teens that it would drive them away from troublespots.Few could argue that harnessing classical music to keep the peace is anything but a fine idea. But music (or noise, depending on the age of the definer) has been used for far more sinister purposes too. In the second world war rumours circulated of a giant German sonic device that could be deployed to devastating effect on the battlefield. Fortunately its vast size and almost complete lack of portability reputedly limited its destructive potential. During the cold war similar devices were said to be in development on both sides of the Iron Curtain.Even in 1999 Human Rights Watch, a pressure group, fearful of the humanitarian threats posed by acoustic weapons, monitored developments. Since then the group has gone quiet but its concern may not be misplaced. America’s military has shown that it is prepared to deploy sound to its tactical advantage. After America’s invasion of Panama in 1989 its intention to seize Manuel Noriega, the head of state it accused of drug running, was thwarted after he took refuge in Panama City’s Vatican embassy. A siege lasting nearly two weeks was broken only after the forces surrounding the embassy played deafening rock music 24 hours a day (including Van Halen and Guns 'n' Roses), over loudspeakers that ringed the compound.America’s armed forces are also accused of using loud rap music and television theme tunes to disorient and disturb prisoners both in Iraq and Gunatanamo Bay. Another technique is to impose absolute silence as part of a sensory-deprivation programme. And both American and Israeli armies and some less scrupulous police forces around the world are said to have used a sonic tool, the “long range acoustic device”. It emits unpleasant high-pitched wails that are intended to disperse crowds. In 2005 a cruise ship even reported its use to repel pirates off the coast of Somalia. But the effectiveness of the device is subject to much dispute.Nevertheless the aggressive use of music and tailor-made sounds is becoming more commonplace. But these weapons, like any others, risk falling into the wrong hands. The simple technologies that are the bad neighbour’s weapon of choice (big speakers, “bad” music) might be turned against their users. Rap and heavy metal music is freely available though more fiendish musical terroriser might even choose experimental jazz or Maltese folk music. Hefty speakers are bought and sold openly too.British teenagers have already shown how the table can be turned. Using mobile phones to record the silent-to-many output of the Mosquito machines they have used the sound to disrupt classes by irritating fellow students while teachers remain oblivious. And in schoolrooms, where mobiles are banned, the sound is a useful semi-private ringtone. In an already noisy world an arms race of sound is not to be welcomed.
