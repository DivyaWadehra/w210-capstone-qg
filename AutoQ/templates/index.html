  <p class="intro">This site is designed to help improve reading comprehension for English-language learners or for anyone
    looking to study up on a new topic. Starting with the articles from Wikipedia, we have developed algorithms to produce
    reading comprehension questions designed to mimic the style of questions seen on the TOEFL exam. Improving reading
    comprehension stems from practice on new material. <br>

    <h2>Our Project</h2>
    <p>AutoQ is the first free web app with automatically generated reading comprehension questions targeted to English
      language learners. Our product utilizes state of the art machine learning and natural language processing techniques
      to create a vast and topical collection of multiple-choice questions that mimic English-language exam formats. We
      currently offer over 10,000 practice questions on over 2,500 new Wikipedia articles.</p>

    <h2>Help Us Improve</h2>
    <p>There’s always room for improvement! We’ve incorporated this into our site via the feedback buttons. One of the downsides
      of using automatic approaches for this is that we may occasionally show questions that aren’t up to our human standards.
      We just don’t have enough time to check every single output, so we’d appreciate it if you could help us as you use this
      tool. We can then use your feedback to produce more natural questions and improve on what’s already here, or remove
      ill-formed questions.</p>
